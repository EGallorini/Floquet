	abstract = {Recent work on the flow past a rotating cylinder is reviewed and further investigated at low Reynolds numbers. The various two- and three-dimensional transitions that occur as the rotation rate is increased are detailed. Two steady states, steady state I and steady state II, are identified based on the physical characteristics of the wake and the drag force on the body. Steady state I occurs at lower rotation rates, while state steady state II occurs at higher rotation rates. Linear stability analysis shows that two three-dimensional modes become unstable on steady state I and steady state II. Floquet stability analysis of the unsteady base flows that occur at very low rotation rates shows the presence of five three-dimensional modes. The curves of marginal stability are presented, followed by a comparison of numerical simulations to their experimentally obtained counterparts. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal characteristics of each mode and the likely underlying physical mechanisms are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The wake behind a cube with a face normal to the flow was investigated experimentally in a water tunnel using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) visualisation and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Measurements were carried out for moderate Reynolds numbers between 100 and 400 and in this range a sequence of two flow bifurcations was confirmed. Values for both onsets were determined in the framework of Landau’s instability model. The measured longitudinal vorticity was separated into three components corresponding to each of the identified regimes. It was shown that the vorticity associated with a basic flow regime originates from corners of the bluff body, in contrast to the two other contributions which are related to instability effects. The present experimental results are compared with numerical simulation carried out earlier by Saha (Phys. Fluids, vol. 16, 2004, pp. 1630–1646).},

abstract = {We consider the stability of the steady, axisymmetric wake of a disk and a sphere as a function of the Reynolds number. Both the direct and adjoint eigenvalue problems are solved. The threshold Reynolds numbers and characteristics of the destabilizing modes agree with that documented in previous studies: for both configurations, the first destabilization occurs for a stationary mode of azimuthal wavenumber m=1, and the second destabilization for an oscillating mode of same azimuthal wavenumber. For both geometries, the adjoint mode computation allows us to determine the receptivity of each mode to particular initial conditions or forcing and to define control strategies. We show that the adjoint global mode reaches a maximum amplitude within the recirculating bubble and downstream of the separation point for both the disk and the sphere. In the case of the sphere, the optimal forcing corresponds to a displacement of the separation point along the sphere surface with no tilt of the separation line. However, in the case of the disk, its blunt shape does not allow such displacement and the optimal forcing corresponds to a tilt of the separation line with no displacement of the separation point. As a result, the magnitudes of the adjoint global modes are larger for the sphere than for the disk, showing that the wake of the sphere is more receptive to forcing than the disk. In the case of active control at the boundary through blowing and suction at the body wall, the actuator should be placed close to the separation point, where the magnitude of the adjoint pressure reaches its maximum in the four cases. In the case of passive control, we show that the region of the wake that is most sensitive to local modifications of the linearized Navier–Stokes operator, including base flow alterations, is limited to the recirculating bubble for both geometries and both instability modes. This region may therefore be identified as the intrinsical wavemaker.}

As a result, both the mean and instantaneous flow patterns are highly influenced by instabilities leading to transition to turbulence. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to investigate the primary and secondary instabilities of a separated boundary layer transition on a flat plate with a blunt leading edge. The Reynolds number based on the uniform inlet velocity and the plate thickness is 6500. A dynamic subgrid-scale model is employed to compute the subgrid-scale stresses more accurately in the transitional flow case. Statistics of the LES are found to be in acceptable agreement with the available experimental data. Based on the characteristic frequency from the velocity and pressure spectra, the LES results confirm that transition starts with the primary 2D instability originating from the free shear in the bubble as the free shear layer is inviscidly unstable via the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz mechanism. The flow visualisation together with the spectral analysis for the velocity components and pressure give strong indication of the dominance of the helical-pairing instability which could be mainly responsible for the breakdown to turbulence.},

The work is based on the anisotropic generalised Kolmogorov equations, exact budget equations for the second-order structure function tensor in the space of scales and in the physical space. Scale-space energy fluxes show that forward and reverse energy transfers occur simultaneously in the flow, with interesting modelling implications. Over the longitudinal cylinder side, the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of the leading edge shear layer generates large spanwise rolls, which get stretched into hairpin-like vortices and eventually break down into smaller streamwise vortices. Independent sources of velocity fluctuations act at different scales. The flow dynamics is dominated by pressure–strain: the flow impingement on the cylinder surface in the reattachment zone produces spanwise velocity fluctuations very close to the wall, and at larger wall distances reorients them to feed streamwise-aligned vortices. In the near wake, large von Kármán-like vortices are shed from the trailing edge and coexist with smaller turbulent structures, each with its own independent production mechanism. At the trailing edge, the sudden disappearance of the wall changes the structure of turbulence: streamwise vortices vanish progressively, while spanwise structures close to the wall are suddenly turned into vertical fluctuations by the pressure–strain.},

The non-inclined square cylinders are located on a line with a staggered angle of 45{$\circ$}to the oncoming velocity vector. All numerical simulations are carried out with a finite-volume code based on a collocated grid arrangement. The effects of vortex shedding on the various features of the flow field are numerically visualized using different flow contours such as {$\lambda$}2criterion, vorticity, pressure and magnitudes of velocity to distinguish the distinctive flow patterns. By changing the gap spacing between cylinders, five different flow regimes are identified and classified as single body, periodic gap flow, aperiodic, modulated periodic and synchronized vortex shedding regimes. This study revealed that the observed multiple frequencies in global forces of the downstream cylinder in the modulated periodic regime are more properly associated with differences in vortex shedding frequencies of individual cylinders than individual shear layers reported in some previous works; particularly, both shear layers from the downstream cylinder often shed vortices at the same multiple frequencies. The maximum Strouhal number for the upstream cylinder is also identified at G{${_\ast}$}= 1 for aperiodic flow pattern. Furthermore, for most cases studied, the downstream cylinder experiences larger drag force than the upstream cylinder. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of the flow around a bluff body of square cross-section in contact with a solid-wall boundary are investigated numerically using a finite difference procedure. Previous studies (Taneda, 1965; Kamemoto et al., 1984) have shown qualitatively the strong influence of solid-wall boundaries on the vortex-shedding process and the formation of the vortex street downstream. In the present study three cases are investigated which correspond to flow past a square rib in a freestream, flow past a rib on a fixed wall and flow past a rib on a sliding wall. Values of the Reynolds number studied ranged from 100 to 2000, where the Reynolds number is based on the rib height, H, and bulk stream velocity, Ub. Comparisons between the sliding-wall and fixed-wall cases show that the sliding wall has a significant destabilizing effect on the recirculation region behind the rib. Results show the onset of unsteadiness at a lower Reynolds number for the sliding-wall case (50 {$\leq$} Recrit {$\leq$}100) than for the fixed-wall case (Recrit{$\geq$}100). A careful examination of the vortex-shedding process reveals similarities between the sliding-wall case and both the freestream and fixed-wall cases. At moderate Reynolds numbers (Re{$\geq$}250) the sliding-wall results show that the rib periodically sheds vortices of alternating circulation in much the same manner as the rib in a freestream; as in, for example, Davis and Moore [1982]. The vortices are distributed asymmetrically downstream of the rib and are not of equal strength as in the freestream case. However, the sliding-wall case shows no tendency to develop cycle-to-cycle variations at higher Reynolds numbers, as observed in the freestream and fixed-wall cases. Thus, while the moving wall causes the flow past the rib to become unsteady at a lower Reynolds number than in the fixed-wall case, it also acts to stabilize or ``lock-in'' the vortex-shedding frequency. This is attributed to the additional source of positive vorticity immediately downstream of the rib on the sliding wall.},

The numerical method and the code for the solution of incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations are validated for the flow past a single and two tandem square cylinders, and the numerical results show a good agreement with the available literatures. The study then focuses on the effect of spacing ratio (ratio of center-to-center distance s to cylinder width d, widely ranging in s/d=1.5\textendash 15.0) on flow characteristics by identifying flow patterns and extracting pressure distributions, force statistics as well as wake oscillation frequencies. Numerical results showed six different flow patterns, which appeared successively with the increase of gap spacing, namely, steady wake, non-fully developed vortex street in single row and double-row, fully developed vortex street in double-row, fully developed vortex street in partially recovered single-row and fully developed multiple vortex streets. A shielding effect of the first cylinder and reducing Bernoulli effect on the rear cylinder rows work in the pressure distribution even at very large gap spacing. In the vortex shedding regime, beyond the critical spacing of wake mode transition, force statistics show a periodic variation characteristic for the last four cylinders; moreover, multiple frequency components involve in the vortex shedding oscillation behind these cylinders and the dominant frequency jumps down with the increase of the spacing. Finally, the flow fields around the critical spacing range are comprehensively analyzed to reveal the crucial mechanism behind the observed aerodynamic characteristics.},

The cylinder spanned the test section of a wind tunnel and was aligned with its axis parallel to a long plate and normal to the free stream. It was placed 36 diameters downstream of the leading edge of the plate and its height above the plate was varied from zero, the cylinder lying on the surface, to 3{$\cdot$}5 cylinder diameters. The thickness of the turbulent boundary layer on the plate at the cylinder position, but with it removed from the tunnel, was equal to 0{$\cdot$}8 of the cylinder diameter. Distributions of mean pressure around the cylinder and along the plate were measured at a Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter, of 4{$\cdot$}5 \texttimes{} 104. Spectral analysis of hot-wire signals demonstrated that regular vortex shedding was suppressed for all gaps less than about 0{$\cdot$}3 cylinder diameters. For gaps greater than 0{$\cdot$}3 the Strouhal number was found to be remarkably constant and the only influence of the plate on vortex shedding was to make it a more highly tuned process as the gap was reduced. Flow-visualization experiments in a smoke tunnel revealed the wake structure at various gap-to-diameter ratios.},

As such, it may be considered as an extension of the works by McKeon \&amp; Sharma (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336\textendash 382) to non-parallel flows and by Turton et al. (Phys. Rev. E, vol. 91 (4), 2015, 043009) to broadband flows. Considering a Reynolds decomposition of the flow field, the spectral (or temporal Fourier) mode of the fluctuation field is found to be equal to the action on a turbulent forcing term by the resolvent operator arising from linearisation about the mean flow. The main result of the article states that if, at a particular frequency, the dominant singular value of the resolvent is much larger than all others and if the turbulent forcing at this frequency does not display any preferential direction toward one of the suboptimal forcings, then the spectral mode is directly proportional to the dominant optimal response mode of the resolvent at this frequency. Such conditions are generally met in the case of weakly non-parallel open flows exhibiting a convectively unstable mean flow. The spatial structure of the singular mode may in these cases be approximated by a local spatial stability analysis based on parabolised stability equations (PSE). We have also shown that the frequency spectrum of the flow field at any arbitrary location of the domain may be predicted from the frequency evolution of the dominant optimal response mode and the knowledge of the frequency spectrum at one or more points. Results are illustrated in the case of a high Reynolds number turbulent backward facing step flow.},

The cases studied include mixing layers in water and in gases, the latter at uniform density and also at a density ratio of 7, using nitrogen and helium respectively in the two streams between which the mixing layer develops. The effects of Reynolds number and of initial conditions on these developments are determined from several flow visualization techniques and from measurements of mixedness, employing concentration probes for the experiments in gases and chemical-reaction indicators for those in water. It is found that the effect of increasing Reynolds number is mainly to introduce small-scale, three-dimensional structure into the flow. This has the effect of increasing the internal mixedness of the shear layer but it does not break down the large primary structures, which continue to develop and interact.}

The dissipation is fluid dominated, though details of the contact mechanics depend on the surface and bulk properties of the solids. Our experiments and a model calculation indicate that mechanical contact between the two colliding objects is generic and will occur for any realistic surface roughness.},

Here we examine the issue of quasiperiodic versus subharmonic instability modes of time-periodic laminar wakes, and how the relationship between them is influenced by weak symmetry breaking. The examples used are the vortex street wake of a circular cylinder, where symmetry is broken by distorting the cylinder into a ring, and the wake of a square cylinder, where symmetry is broken by a small fixed rotation of the cylinder about its axis. In both cases the symmetric wakes exhibit a quasiperiodic instability mode, with a pair of complex-conjugate Floquet multipliers and which manifests as a traveling wave. As symmetry is broken these multipliers migrate continuously to the real axis, coalesce, and split into a pair of subharmonic multipliers that move apart along the negative real axis. This behavior resolves an apparent dichotomy between the previously established theoretical results and numerical predictions for the symmetric wake systems, and the predictions and experimental observations for systems with weakly broken symmetry.},

The mechanism, termed the vortex shedding mechanism (VSM) is simple and intuitive, requiring only two coincident conditions in the flow: (1) the existence of a location with zero momentum and (2) the presence of a net force having a positive divergence. Numerical solutions of several model problems illustrate causality of the VSM. Moreover, the VSM criteria is proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a vortex splitting event in any two-dimensional, incompressible flow. The VSM is shown to exist in several canonical problems including the external flow past a circular cylinder. Suppression of the von K\'arm\'an vortex street is demonstrated for Reynolds numbers of 100 and 400 by mitigating the VSM.},

Wall functions are used with both versions. The standard model was found to damp the shedding motion unrealistically so that shedding was suppressed at considerably larger gap widths than observed experimentally. The Kato-Launder modification yields reasonable predictions over the full range of gap widths; for GwD=0.75 a quantitative comparison is presented with the authors' phase-resolved experiments, which shows fairly good accord.},

The initiation mechanism for vortex shedding and the evaluation of the unsteady body forces are presented for Reynolds-number values of 100, 200 and 1000.The vortex shedding is generated by a physical perturbation imposed numerically for a short time. The flow transition becomes periodic after a transient time interval.

  abstract = {The flow around a pair of side-by-side square cylinders placed in a two-dimensional channel is computed using the lattice Boltzmann method. The Reynolds number is Red=dU0/{$\nu$}=73 (d is the side of the cylinder, U0 the upstream velocity, and {$\nu$} the kinematic viscosity of the fluid) while the lateral separations between the cylinders, s{${_\ast}\equiv$}s/d, ranges between 0.5 and 6. Upon varying the cylinder spacing, in-phase, in-antiphase and quasi-periodic regimes are observed, by considering the lift and drag forces on the bodies. The relative coefficients vary substantially (in terms of mean and fluctuation rms values) in the range considered, while the Strouhal number is almost constant and near 0.16. The quasi-periodic regime, characterised by a second frequency much lower than the shedding, is studied in most detail. It is shown that the amplitude of the modulation follows a regular pattern in time that can be reproduced by a system of coupled Landau equations.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations were used to investigate the supercritical aerodynamics of a square cylinder with rounded corners in comparison with those in the subcritical regime. First, the numerical methods, especially the dynamic mixed model, were validated on the basis of their prediction of supercritical flows past a circular cylinder. Then, the supercritical flows past a rounded-corner square cylinder were simulated and systematically clarified. Strong Reynolds number (Re) effects existed in the forces and local pressures as Re increased from o(104) to o(106). Changeover of flow patterns occurred as Re increased. At the supercritical Re, the free stream overall flowed along the cross sections of the cylinder, separated from the leeward corners and generated Karman vortices behind the cylinder. This pattern resulted in a much smaller recirculation region behind the cylinder compared with the subcritical flow. At the micro level, the flow experienced laminar separation and flow reattachment near the frontal corners, followed by the spatial development of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) on the side faces and turbulent separation near the leeward corners. The feedback by large-scale primary vortex shedding and the small-scale turbulent motions in the high-frequency region with a slope of -5/3 were detected in the TBL. Their interaction affected the spanwise correlations of wall pressure fluctuations. The TBL on the side face differed from the zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate one; it was subjected to pressure gradients varying in space and time.},

If free-stream disturbances are significant, as is likely in most practical cases, including a mixing layer entraining `still air' from the surroundings, three-dimensionality develops at an early stage in transition. Other recent experiments strongly suggest that the Brown-Roshko structure will not form if the initial mixing layer is turbulent or subject to instability modes other than spanwise vortices. Therefore the Brown-Roshko structure will be rare in practice. The alternative large structure in a mixing layer, found by several workers, is intense, but fully three-dimensional and thus less orderly than the Brown-Roshko structure.The balance of evidence suggests that if the Brown-Roshko structure does appear it will eventually relax into the alternative fully three-dimensional form: the K\'arm\'an vortex street behind a bluff body provides a precedent for slow development of three-dimensionality. However the Brown-Roshko structure, if formed, may well relax so slowly as to be identifiable for the full length of a practical flow.},

  abstract = {A detailed numerical study of the separating and reattaching flow over a square leading-edge plate is presented, examining the instability modes governing transition from two- to three-dimensional flow. Under the influence of background noise, experiments show that the transition scenario typically is incompletely described by either global stability analysis or the transient growth of dominant optimal perturbation modes. Instead two-dimensional transition effectively can be triggered by the convective Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz (KH) shear-layer instability; although it may be possible that this could be described alternatively in terms of higher-order optimal perturbation modes. At least in some experiments, observed transition occurs by either: (i) KH vortices shedding downstream directly and then almost immediately undergoing three-dimensional transition or (ii) at higher Reynolds numbers, larger vortical structures are shed that are also three-dimensionally unstable. These two paths lead to distinctly different three-dimensional arrangements of vortical flow structures. This paper focuses on the mechanisms underlying these three-dimensional transitions. Floquet analysis of weakly periodically forced flow, mimicking the observed two-dimensional quasi-periodic base flow, indicates that the two-dimensional vortex rollers shed from the recirculation region become globally three-dimensionally unstable at a Reynolds number of approximately 380. This transition Reynolds number and the predicted wavelength and flow symmetries match well with those of the experiments. The instability appears to be elliptical in nature with the perturbation field mainly restricted to the cores of the shed rollers and showing the spatial vorticity distribution expected for that instability type. Indeed an estimate of the theoretical predicted wavelength is also a good match to the prediction from Floquet analysis and theoretical estimates indicate the growth rate is positive. Fully three-dimensional simulations are also undertaken to explore the nonlinear development of the three-dimensional instability. These show the development of the characteristic upright hairpins observed in the experimental dye visualisations. The three-dimensional instability that manifests at lower Reynolds numbers is shown to be consistent with an elliptic instability of the KH shear-layer vortices in both symmetry and spanwise wavelength.},

The book is one of the first to integrate a vast amount of cutting-edge material on Delaunay triangulations. It begins with introducing the problem of mesh generation and describing algorithms for constructing Delaunay triangulations. The authors then present algorithms for generating high-quality meshes in polygonal and polyhedral domains. They also illustrate how to use restricted Delaunay triangulations to extend the algorithms to surfaces with ridges and patches and volumes with smooth surfaces. For researchers and graduate students, the book offers a rigorous theoretical analysis of mesh generation methods. It provides the necessary mathematical foundations and core theoretical results upon which researchers can build even better algorithms in the future. For engineers, the book shows how the algorithms work well in practice. It explains how to effectively implement them in the design and programming of mesh generation software.},

Aspect ratios ranging between \$0.25\$ and \$30\$ are considered. We show that the critical Reynolds number (\$\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_c\$) corresponding to the primary instability increases with the aspect ratio, starting from \$\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_c \textbackslash approx 34.8\$ for \$AR=0.25\$ to a value of \$\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_c \textbackslash approx 140\$ for \$AR = 30\$. The unstable mode and its dependence on the aspect ratio are described. We find that positioning a small circular cylinder in the flow modifies the instability in a way strongly depending on the aspect ratio. The rounded corners affect the primary instability in a way that depends on both the aspect ratio and the curvature radius. For small \$AR\$, rounding the leading-edge corners has always a stabilising effect, whereas rounding the trailing-edge corners is destabilising, although for large curvature radii only. For intermediate \$AR\$, instead, rounding the leading-edge corners has a stabilising effect limited to small curvature radii only, while for \$AR \textbackslash geqslant 5\$ it has always a destabilising effect. In contrast, for \$AR \textbackslash geqslant 2\$ rounding the trailing-edge corners consistently increases \$\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_c\$. Interestingly, when all the corners are rounded, the flow becomes more stable, at all aspect ratios. An explanation for the stabilising and destabilising effect of the rounded corners is provided.},

  abstract = {,  In the flow past elongated rectangular cylinders at moderate Reynolds numbers, vortices shedding from the leading- and trailing-edge corners are frequency locked by the impinging leading-edge vortex instability. The present work investigates how the chord-based Strouhal number varies with the aspect ratio of the cylinder at a Reynolds number (based on the cylinder thickness and the free-stream velocity) of {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}$}=400Re=400Re=400, i.e. when locking is strong. Several two-dimensional, nonlinear simulations are run for rectangular and D-shaped cylinders, with the aspect ratio ranging from 111 to 111111, and a global linear stability analysis of the flow is performed. The shedding frequency observed in the nonlinear simulations is predicted fairly well by the eigenfrequency of the leading eigenmode. The inspection of the structural sensitivity confirms the central role of the trailing-edge vortex shedding in the frequency locking, as already assumed by other authors. Surprisingly, however, the stepwise increase of the Strouhal number with the aspect ratio reported by several previous works is not fully reproduced. Indeed, with increasing aspect ratio, two distinct flow behaviours are observed, associated with two flow configurations where the interaction between the leading- and trailing-edge vortices is different. These two configurations are fully characterised, and the mechanism of selection of the flow configuration is discussed. Lastly, for aspect ratios close to the jump between two consecutive shedding modes, the Strouhal number is found to present hysteresis, implying the existence of multiple stable configurations. Continuing the lower shedding-mode branch by increasing the aspect ratio, we found that the periodic configuration loses stability via a Neimark\textendash Sacker bifurcation leading to different Arnold tongues. This hysteresis can explain, at least partially, the significant scatter of existing experimental and numerical data.},

  abstract = {The objective of this review is to critically assess the different approaches developed in recent years to understand the dynamics of open flows such as mixing layers, jets, wakes, separation bubbles, boundary layers, and so on. These complex flows develop in extended domains in which fluid particles are continuously advected downstream. They behave either as noise amplifiers or as oscillators, both of which exhibit strong nonlinearities (Huerre \& Monkewitz 1990). The local approach is inherently weakly nonparallel and it assumes that the basic flow varies on a long length scale compared to the wavelength of the instability waves. The dynamics of the flow is then considered as a superposition of linear or nonlinear instability waves that, at leading order, behave at each streamwise station as if the flow were homogeneous in the streamwise direction. In the fully global context, the basic flow and the instabilities do not have to be characterized by widely separated length scales, and the dynamics is then viewed as the result of the interactions between Global modes living in the entire physical domain with the streamwise direction as an eigendirection. This second approach is more and more resorted to as a result of increased computational capability. The earlier review of Huerre \& Monkewitz (1990) emphasized how local linear theory can account for the noise amplifier behavior as well as for the onset of a Global mode. The present survey first adopts the opposite point of view by demonstrating how fully global theory accounts for the noise amplifier behavior of open flows. From such a perspective, there is strong emphasis on the very peculiar nonorthogonality of linear Global modes, which in turn allows a novel interpretation of recent numerical simulations and experimental observations. The nonorthogonality of linear Global modes also imposes severe constraints on the extension of linear global theory to the fully nonlinear r\'egime. When the flow is weakly nonparallel, this limitation is so severe that the linear Global mode theory is of little help. It is then much more appropriate to develop a fully nonlinear formulation involving the presence of a front separating the base state region from the bifurcated state region.},

The aim is to provide evidence of the influence of relevant flow parameters such as the geometry of the leading-edge corner, the presence of a trailing-edge flow separation, and of a flow coupling between the two sides of the plate. The results reveal that flows with right-angled corners develop taller flow recirculations, which promote very-slow instability of the bubble itself. This large-scale unsteadiness is then found to be the basis of negative turbulence production mechanisms that in turn enhance the height of the bubble itself, thus closing a self-sustained cycle. The absence of these phenomena in flows with smooth leading-edge corners is also found to explain their high sensitivity to free-stream turbulence. The observed behaviors may have strong repercussions for theories and closures of separating and reattaching flows and should be carefully taken into account in control strategies used in the applications.},

  abstract = {The viscous and inviscid linear stability of the incompressible flow past a square open cavity is studied numerically. The analysis shows that the flow first undergoes a steady three-dimensional bifurcation at a critical Reynolds number of 1370. The critical mode is localized inside the cavity and has a flat roll structure with a spanwise wavelength of about 0.47 cavity depths. The adjoint global mode reveals that the instability is most efficiently triggered in the thin region close to the upstream tip of the cavity. The structural sensitivity analysis identifies the wavemaker as the region located inside the cavity and spatially concentrated around a closed orbit. As the flow outside the cavity plays no role in the generation mechanisms leading to the bifurcation, we confirm that an appropriate parameter to describe the critical conditions in open cavity flows is the Reynolds number based on the average velocity between the two upper edges. Stabilization is achieved by a decrease of the total momentum inside the shear layer that drives the core vortex within the cavity. The mechanism of instability is then studied by means of a short-wavelength approximation considering pressureless inviscid modes. The closed streamline related to the maximum inviscid growth rate is found to be the same as that around which the global wavemaker is concentrated. The structural sensitivity field based on direct and adjoint eigenmodes, computed at a Reynolds number far higher than that of the base flow, can predict the critical orbit on which the main instabilities inside the cavity arise. Further, we show that the sub-leading unstable time-dependent modes emerging at supercritical conditions are characterized by a period that is a multiple of the revolution time of Lagrangian particles along the orbit of maximum growth rate. The eigenfrequencies of these modes, computed by global stability analysis, are in very good agreement with the asymptotic results.},

  abstract = {The study of the stability of a dynamical system described by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) requires the computation of unstable states as the control parameter exceeds its critical threshold. Unfortunately, the discretization of the governing equations, especially for fluid dynamic applications, often leads to very large discrete systems. As a consequence, matrix based methods, like for example the Newton\textendash Raphson algorithm coupled with a direct inversion of the Jacobian matrix, lead to computational costs too large in terms of both memory and execution time. We present a novel iterative algorithm, inspired by Krylov-subspace methods, which is able to compute unstable steady states and/or accelerate the convergence to stable configurations. Our new algorithm is based on the minimization of the residual norm at each iteration step with a projection basis updated at each iteration rather than at periodic restarts like in the classical GMRES method. The algorithm is able to stabilize any dynamical system without increasing the computational time of the original numerical procedure used to solve the governing equations. Moreover, it can be easily inserted into a pre-existing relaxation (integration) procedure with a call to a single black-box subroutine. The procedure is discussed for problems of different sizes, ranging from a small two-dimensional system to a large three-dimensional problem involving the Navier\textendash Stokes equations. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the convergence of existing iterative schemes. In particular, the procedure is applied to the subcritical flow inside a lid-driven cavity. We also discuss the application of Boostconv to compute the unstable steady flow past a fixed circular cylinder (2D) and boundary-layer flow over a hemispherical roughness element (3D) for supercritical values of the Reynolds number. We show that Boostconv can be used effectively with any spatial discretization, be it a finite-difference, finite-volume, finite-element or spectral method.},

To understand these phenomena we need to model both the structure and the fluid. However, in keeping with the overall theme of this volume, the emphasis here is on the fluid models. Also, the applications are largely drawn from aerospace engineering although the methods and fundamental physical phenomena have much wider applications. In the present article, we emphasize recent developments and future challenges. To provide a context for these, the article begins with a description of the various physical models for a fluid undergoing time-dependent motion, then moves to a discussion of the distinction between linear and nonlinear models, time-linearized models and their solution in either the time or frequency domains, and various methods for treating nonlinear models, including time marching, harmonic balance, and systems identification. We conclude with an extended treatment of the modal character of time-dependent flows and the construction of reduced-order models based on an expansion in terms of fluid modes. The emphasis is on the enhanced physical understanding and dramatic reductions in computational cost made possible by reduced-order models, time linearization, and methodologies drawn from dynamical system theory.},

Spectral data from a hot-wire probe showed that a substantial fraction of the measured turbulence intensity occurs at frequencies significantly lower than the large eddy passing frequency. Several thermal tuft probes were used simultaneously to identify the source of the low-frequency disturbances. It was concluded that the reattaching free shear layer undergoes a non-periodic, roughly two-dimensional, vertical motion. The motion causes the impingement point of the reattaching shear layer to drift slowly up- and downstream over a range of approximately two step heights. The likely cause of the low-frequency motion is an instantaneous imbalance between the entrain-ment rate from the recirculation zone and the reinjection rate near reattachment.},

Although the problem has attracted attention for ages, it is only recently that the tremendous progress in the development of experimental and computational techniques and the emergence of new theoretical concepts have led to a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. This review attempts to bring together the main recent experimental, computational, and theoretical advances obtained on this fascinating subject. To this end it describes the first steps of the transition in the wake of a fixed body and its connection with the onset and development of the path instability of moving bodies.

We examine several preconditioners for the consistent L2Poisson operator arising in the PN- PN-2spectral element formulation of the incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations. We develop a finite element-based additive Schwarz preconditioner using overlapping subdomains plus a coarse grid projection operator which is applied directly to the pressure on the interior Gauss points.

The method is applied to a model problem of flow over a backstep in a doubly infinite channel, using clustered conformal co-ordinates. One-dimensional stretching functions, dependent on the Reynolds number and the asymptotic behaviour of the flow, are used to provide suitable grid distribution in the separation and reattachment regions, as well as in the inflow and outflow regions. The optimum grid distribution selected attempts to honour the multiple length scales of the separated flow model problem.

The reasons for such mismatch are briefly discussed and possible improvements to the present analysis are suggested.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the three-dimensional secondary instability of a circular-cylinder wake to a structural perturbation of the associated linear equations is investigated. In particular, for a given flow condition, the region of maximum coupling between the velocity components is localized by using the most unstable Floquet mode and its adjoint mode. The variation of this region in time is also found by considering a structural perturbation which is impulsively applied in time at a given phase of the vortex-shedding process. The analysis is carried out for both mode A and mode B types of transition in the wake of a circular cylinder using a finite-difference code. The resulting regions identified as the core of the instability are in full agreement with the results reported in the literature and with the a posteriori checks documented here.},

  abstract = {The stability properties of selected flow configurations, usually denoted as base flows, can be significantly altered by small modifications of the flow, which can be caused, for instance, by a non-intrusive passive control. This aspect is amply demonstrated in the literature by ad~hoc sensitivity studies which, however, focus on configurations characterised by a steady base flow. Nevertheless, several flow configurations of interest are characterised by a time-periodic base flow. To this purpose, we propose here an original theoretical framework suitable to quantify the effects of base-flow variations in the stability properties of saturated time-periodic limit cycles. In particular, starting from a Floquet analysis of the linearised Navier\textendash Stokes equations and using adjoint methods, it is possible to estimate the variation of a selected Floquet exponent caused by a generic structural perturbation of the base-flow equations. This link is expressed concisely using the adjoint operators coming from the analysis, and the final result, when applied to spatially localised disturbances, is used to build spatial sensitivity and control maps. These maps identify the regions of the flow where the placement of a infinitesimal small object produces the largest effect on the Floquet exponent and may also provide a quantification of this effect. Such analysis brings useful insights both for passive control strategies and for further characterising the investigated instability. As an example of application, the proposed analysis is applied here to the three-dimensional flow instabilities in the wake past a circular cylinder. This is a classical problem which has been widely studied in the literature. Nevertheless, by applying the proposed analysis we derive original results comprising a further characterisation of the instability and related control maps. We finally show that the control maps obtained here are in very good agreement with control experiments documented in the literature.},

  abstract = {The stability properties of the flow past an infinitely long circular cylinder are studied in the context of linear theory. An immersed-boundary technique is used to represent the cylinder surface on a Cartesian mesh. The characteristics of both direct and adjoint perturbation modes are studied and the regions of the flow more sensitive to momentum forcing and mass injection are identified. The analysis shows that the maximum of the perturbation envelope amplitude is reached far downstream of the separation bubble, where as the highest receptivity is attained in the near wake of the cylinder, close to the body surface. The large difference between the spatial structure of the two-dimensional direct and adjoint modes suggests that the instability mechanism cannot be identified from the study of either eigenfunctions separately. For this reason a structural stability analysis of the problem is used to analyse the process which gives rise to the self-sustained mode. In particular, the region of maximum coupling among the velocity components is localized by inspecting the spatial distribution of the product between the direct and adjoint modes. Results show that the instability mechanism is located in two lobes placed symmetrically across the separation bubble, confirming the qualitative results obtained through a locally plane-wave analysis. The relevance of this novel technique to the development of effective control strategies for vortex shedding behind bluff bodies is illustrated by comparing the theoretical predictions based on the structural perturbation analysis with the experimental data of Strykowski \& Sreenivasan (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 218, 1990, p. 71).},

A parallel is drawn between the formulations of this zonal approach  and that of rapid distortion theory, better known to the turbulence community. The  results presented confirm those obtained by the standard stability analysis based on  normal-mode decomposition: depending on the rotation parameter and the oblique  mode considered, three unstable zones are identified, related to the centrifugal, elliptic  and hyperbolic instabilities, as observed for Taylor\textendash Green cells (Sipp et al. 1999).  Anticyclonic rotation is shown to destabilize Stuart vortices through a combination  of the elliptical and centrifugal instability mechanisms, depending on the ratio of  its rate to the structure core vorticity. Available stability criteria are discussed in the  general case of two-dimensional rotating flows, in relation to their streamline topology  and the values of the local Rossby number or vorticity.},

Here we apply analogous arguments to myriapod CPGs. Analyses based on symmetry applied to~these networks lead to testable predictions, including a distinction between primary and secondary gaits, the existence of a new primary gait called `jump', and the occurrence of half-integer wave numbers in myriapod gaits. For bipeds, our analysis also predicts two gaits with the out-of-phase symmetry of the walk and two gaits with the in-phase symmetry of the hop. We present data that support each of these predictions. This work suggests that symmetry can be used to infer a plausible class of CPG network architectures from observed patterns of animal gaits.},

A semi-circular bump is located on one side of the channel and the extent of blockage is varied by adjusting the radius of the bump. The blockage is varied between 0.05 and 0.9 of the channel width and the upstream Reynolds number between 25 and 3000. The geometry presents a simplified blockage specified by a single parameter, serving as a starting point for investigations of other more complex blockage geometries. For blockage ratios in excess of 0.4, the variation of reattachment length with Reynolds number collapses to within approximately 15\%, while at lower ratios the behaviour differs. For the constrained two-dimensional flow, various phenomena are identified, such as multiple mini-recirculations contained within the main recirculation bubble and vortex shedding at higher Reynolds numbers. The stability of the flow to three-dimensional perturbations is analysed, revealing a transition to a three-dimensional state at a critical Reynolds number which decreases with higher blockage ratios. Separation lengths and the onset and structure of three-dimensional instability observed from the geometry of blockage ratio 0.5 resemble results taken from backward-facing step investigations. The question of the underlying mechanism behind the instability being either centrifugal or elliptic in nature and operating within the initial recirculation zone is analytically tested.},

  abstract = {Previous work has shown that aspects of the evolution of large-scale structures, particularly in forced and transitional mixing layers and jets, can be described by linear and nonlinear stability theories. However, questions persist as to the choice of the basic (steady) flow field to perturb, and the extent to which disturbances in natural (unforced), initially turbulent jets may be modelled with the theory. For unforced jets, identification is made difficult by the lack of a phase reference that would permit a portion of the signal associated with the instability wave to be isolated from other, uncorrelated fluctuations. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which pressure and velocity fluctuations in subsonic, turbulent round jets can be described as linear perturbations to the mean flow field. The disturbances are expanded about the experimentally measured jet mean flow field, and evolved using linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) that account, in an approximate way, for the weakly non-parallel jet mean flow field. We utilize data from an extensive microphone array that measures pressure fluctuations just outside the jet shear layer to show that, up to an unknown initial disturbance spectrum, the phase, wavelength, and amplitude envelope of convecting wavepackets agree well with PSE solutions at frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers that can be accurately measured with the array. We next apply the proper orthogonal decomposition to near-field velocity fluctuations measured with particle image velocimetry, and show that the structure of the most energetic modes is also similar to eigenfunctions from the linear theory. Importantly, the amplitudes of the modes inferred from the velocity fluctuations are in reasonable agreement with those identified from the microphone array. The results therefore suggest that, to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the evolution of the largest-scale structures that comprise the most energetic portion of the turbulent spectrum of natural jets, nonlinear effects need only be indirectly accounted for by considering perturbations to the mean turbulent flow field, while neglecting any non-zero frequency disturbance interactions.},

  abstract = {Two- and three-dimensional modal and non-modal instability mechanisms of steady spanwise-homogeneous laminar separated flow over airfoil profiles, placed at large angles of attack against the oncoming flow, have been investigated using global linear stability theory. Three NACA profiles of distinct thickness and camber were considered in order to assess geometry effects on the laminar\textendash turbulent transition paths discussed. At the conditions investigated, large-scale steady separation occurs, such that Tollmien\textendash Schlichting and cross-flow mechanisms have not been considered. It has been found that the leading modal instability on all three airfoils is that associated with the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz mechanism, taking the form of the eigenmodes known from analysis of generic bluff bodies. The three-dimensional stationary eigenmode of the two-dimensional laminar separation bubble, associated in earlier analyses with the formation on the airfoil surface of large-scale separation patterns akin to stall cells, is shown to be more strongly damped than the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz mode at all conditions examined. Non-modal instability analysis reveals the potential of the flows considered to sustain transient growth which becomes stronger with increasing angle of attack and Reynolds number. Optimal initial conditions have been computed and found to be analogous to those on a cascade of low pressure turbine blades. By changing the time horizon of the analysis, these linear optimal initial conditions have been found to evolve into the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz mode. The time-periodic base flows ensuing linear amplification of the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz mode have been analysed via temporal Floquet theory. Two amplified modes have been discovered, having characteristic spanwise wavelengths of approximately 0.6 and 2 chord lengths, respectively. Unlike secondary instabilities on the circular cylinder, three-dimensional short-wavelength perturbations are the first to become linearly unstable on all airfoils. Long-wavelength perturbations are quasi-periodic, standing or travelling-wave perturbations that also become unstable as the Reynolds number is further increased. The dominant short-wavelength instability gives rise to spanwise periodic wall-shear patterns, akin to the separation cells encountered on airfoils at low angles of attack and the stall cells found in flight at conditions close to stall.

  abstract = {This paper presents the characteristics of the different stages in the evolution of the wake of a circular cylinder rolling without slipping along a wall at constant speed, acquired through numerical stability analysis and two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations. Reynolds numbers between 30 and 300 are considered. Of importance in this study is the transition to three-dimensionality from the underlying two-dimensional periodic flow and, in particular, the way that the associated transitions influence the fluid forces exerted on the cylinder and the development and the structure of the wake. It is found that the steady two-dimensional flow becomes unstable to three-dimensional perturbations at                                                                {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{c}$},3{$\mathsl{D}$}=37Rec,3D=37Re\_\{c,3D\}=37                                   , and that the transition to unsteady two-dimensional flow \textendash{} or periodic vortex shedding \textendash{} occurs at                                                                {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{c}$},2{$\mathsl{D}$}=88Rec,2D=88Re\_\{c,2D\}=88                                   , thus validating and refining the results of Stewart et~al.~(J.~Fluid Mech. vol.~648, 2010, pp.~225\textendash 256). The main focus here is on Reynolds numbers beyond the transition to unsteady flow at                                                                {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{c}$},2{$\mathsl{D}$}=88Rec,2D=88Re\_\{c,2D\}=88                                   . From impulsive start up, the wake almost immediately undergoes transition to a periodic two-dimensional wake state, which, in turn, is three-dimensionally unstable. Thus, the previous three-dimensional stability analysis based on the two-dimensional steady flow provides only an element of the full story. Floquet analysis based on the periodic two-dimensional flow was undertaken and new three-dimensional instability modes were revealed. The results suggest that an impulsively started cylinder rolling along a surface at constant velocity for                                                                {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\greaterequivlnt$}90Re{$\greaterequivlnt$}90Re\textbackslash gtrsim 90                                    will result in the rapid development of a periodic two-dimensional wake that will be maintained for a considerable time prior to the wake undergoing three-dimensional transition. Of interest, the mean lift and drag coefficients obtained from full three-dimensional simulations match predictions from two-dimensional simulations to within a few per cent.},

  abstract = {, This article examines numerically the two-dimensional fluid\textendash structure interaction problem of a circular cylinder rolling under gravity along an inclined surface under the assumption of a fixed but small gap. The motion of the cylinder is governed by the ratio of cylinder and fluid densities and the Reynolds number based on a velocity scale derived from the momentum balance in the asymptotic regime. For increasing Reynolds number, the cylinder wake undergoes a transition from steady to periodic flow, causing oscillations of the cylinder motion. The critical Reynolds number increases for light cylinders. Whereas the time-averaged characteristics of the asymptotic rolling states depend only on the Reynolds number, the density ratio has an additional influence on the vibration amplitude and on the cylinder motion during a start-up transient from rest. Light cylinders reach their final state quickly after the initial acceleration; heavier cylinders traverse a series of quasi-steady states, including a temporary velocity overshoot, before settling in the asymptotic regime. The amplitudes of the flow-induced vibrations remain small over the entire parameter range, which can be attributed to the value of the added-mass force associated with a rolling cylinder. Special attention is paid to the influence of the small but finite gap between cylinder and wall, since lubrication theory predicts a diverging pressure drag for a vanishing gap. The variations with gap size of the forces, torque and added mass are explored. The gap also influences the characteristics of the cylinder vibrations in the unsteady wake regime, in particular their amplitude.},

  abstract = {The presence of flow separation from both leading and trailing edges of elongated bluff bodies leads to vortex interactions and resonances not observed in shorter bodies such as circular and square cylinders. Stepwise behaviour in the Strouhal number with increasing plate chord-to-thickness ratio has been observed for long bodies in a number of different situations: natural shedding, under transverse forcing, and with excited duct modes. In the present study, an investigation is made of the predicted unforced laminar flow around long plates (up to chord, c, to thickness, t, ratioc /t=16). The two main types of plate geometry considered are rectangular plates and plates with an aerodynamic leading edge. The rectangular plate represents a geometrical extension of the normal flat and square plates. The aerodynamic leading-edge plate is a natural precursor to the rectangular plate because the vortex shedding is only from the trailing edge. The natural flow around rectangular plates is of greater complexity due to the interaction between the leading- and trailing-edge shedding. The previously neglected influence of the trailing-edge vortex shedding is found to play an important role in the stepwise progression of the Strouhal number with chord-to-thickness ratio. In addition, the formation of three-dimensional patterns in the boundary layer along the plate and in the trailing-edge wake is predicted. The predicted boundary layer hairpin vortices are compared with previous observations and the predicted streamwise modes in the wake are compared with those found in the case of circular cylinders.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional and time-periodic wake flows produced by a pitching foil are investigated numerically for a fixed flapping amplitude. As the flapping frequency is increased, three regimes are identified in the time-marching nonlinear simulations. The first regime is characterized by nondeviated wake flows with zero~time-averaged~lift. In the second regime, the wake flow is slightly deviated from the streamwise direction and the time-averaged lift is slightly positive or negative. The third regime is characterized by larger deviations of the wake, associated with larger values of both the time-averaged lift and the thrust. The transition from the first to the second regime is examined by performing a Floquet stability analysis of the nondeviated wake. A specific method is introduced to compute the time-periodic, nondeviated wake when it is unstable. It is found that one synchronous antisymmetric mode becomes unstable at the critical frequency where deviation occurs. Investigation of its instantaneous and time-averaged characteristics show that it acts as a displacement mode translating the nondeviated wake away from the streamwise direction. Finally, it is demonstrated that the transition from the second to the third regime is linked to nonlinear effects that amplify both antisymmetric and symmetric perturbations around the foil.},

The variations of the hydrodynamic forces and wake flow characteristics with the Reynolds number (Re) are examined for Re = 10\textendash 400 with a high resolution in Re. Distinct features in the variation trends of the hydrodynamic forces with Re are examined and explained. In addition, for the 3D flows up to Re = 400, three critical conditions are observed at Re of approximately 165.7, 210, and 330. At the onset of the secondary wake instability of Re = 165.7, a sudden increase or decrease in the 3D flow property with respect to its 2D counterpart is observed, which is due to the sudden increase in the flow three-dimensionality at the mode A instability that is subcritical in nature. The second critical condition is because for Re {$>$} 210, the mode B flow structure becomes increasingly disordered and the wake flow becomes increasingly turbulent such that the 3D flow property is increasingly deviated from its 2D counterpart. The third critical condition at Re {$\sim$} 330 is related to the disappearance and reappearance of the recirculation regions on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder. While the first two critical conditions are also observed for flow past a circular cylinder, the third one is not since the geometry of a circular cylinder does not give rise to recirculation regions on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder.},

The characteristics of the Strouhal\textendash Reynolds number relationship are analysed. At the onset of Mode~A*, a sudden drop of the 3-D Strouhal number from its two-dimensional counterpart is observed, which is due to the subcritical nature of the Mode A* instability. A continuous 3-D Strouhal\textendash Reynolds number curve is observed over the mode swapping regime, since Mode A* and Mode B have extremely close vortex shedding frequencies and therefore only a single merged peak is observed in the frequency spectrum. The existence of hysteresis for the Mode A and Mode B wake instabilities is examined. The unconfined Mode A and Mode B wake instabilities are hysteretic and non-hysteretic, respectively. However, a spanwise confined Mode A could be non-hysteretic. It is proposed that the existence of hysteresis at a wake instability can be identified by examining the sudden/gradual variation of the 3-D flow properties at the onset of the wake instability, with sudden and gradual variations corresponding to hysteretic (subcritical) and non-hysteretic (supercritical) flows, respectively.},

The instability is discussed in the three different contexts\textemdash an unbounded strained vortex, a localized strained vortex, and a triaxial ellipsoid\textemdash where it was originally discovered and then rediscovered. These make it clear that the instability is one of parametric resonance where a normal mode, or pair of normal modes, of the undistorted rotating flow resonates with the underlying strain field. The effects of additional physics on the instability process are examined before its nonlinear evolution is discussed. Various applications of the instability in nature are then reviewed.},

Przemieniecki, AIAA J. 1 (1963) 138]. Currently, due to developments in computer technology, the available on-board memory has increased considerably. Despite the existence of these high-memory systems, the Schur complement method still finds its applications in structural mechanics through parallel computing. When developing a computer program, the Schur method has a significant book-keeping load in comparison to other parallel algorithms used, e.g., Schwarz alternating domain decomposition method [H.A. Schwarz, Gesammelte Mathematiche Abhandlungen, vol. 2, Springer, Berlin, 1890, p. 133]. This results in memory usage. Although parallel systems are used, global coefficient matrices require a large amount of memory. Therefore, significant memory is reserved for the solution of large-scale systems. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for the assemblage and solution of interface equations which facilitates the solution of large-scale systems via the Schur complement method on multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) distributed memory architectures. In this method, we assemble the subdomain and interface coefficient matrices in such a manner that the memory requirements decrease significantly, resulting in the solution of large-scale systems with reasonable memory usage. The computer program is tested on distributed memory architectures with UNIX, WINDOWS NT, and LINUX operating systems.},

Linear stability analysis (LSA) and direct time integration (DTI) of the governing equations for incompressible flows are carried out via a stabilized finite element formulation. The generalized eigenvalue problem resulting from the finite element discretization of the equations from linearized stability analysis is solved using a subspace iteration (SI) method to get the most unstable eigenmode. The results from the two methods are in good agreement. The effect of spatial resolution and location of computational boundaries is investigated. It is found that, for high blockage (ratio of the diameter of cylinder to the lateral width of domain), Rec first decreases and then increases with increase in blockage. It is also observed that the Strouhal number at Rec is quite sensitive to the blockage. This might possibly explain the scatter in the data from various researchers in the past.},

  abstract = {From the solution of the creeping-flow equations, the drag force on a sphere becomes infinite when the gap between the sphere and a smooth wall vanishes at constant velocity, so that if the sphere is displaced towards the wall with a constant applied force, contact theoretically may not occur. Physically, the drag is finite for various reasons, one being the particle and wall roughness. Then, for vanishing gap, even though some layers of fluid molecules may be left between the particle and wall roughness peaks, conventionally it may be said that contact occurs. In this paper, we consider the example of a smooth sphere moving towards a rough wall. The roughness considered here consists of parallel periodic wedges, the wavelength of which is small compared with the sphere radius. This problem is considered both experimentally and theoretically. The motion of a millimetre size bead settling towards a corrugated horizontal wall in a viscous oil is measured with laser interferometry giving an accuracy on the displacement of 0.1 \$\textbackslash mu\$m. Several wedge-shaped walls were used, with various wavelengths and wedge angles.From the results, it is observed that the velocity of the sphere is, except for small gaps, similar to that towards a smooth plane that is shifted down from the top of corrugations. Indeed, earlier theories for a shear flow along a corrugated wall found such an equivalent smooth plane. These theories are revisited here. The creeping flow is calculated as a series in the slope of the roughness grooves. The cases of a flow along and across the grooves are considered separately. The shift is larger in the former case. Slightly flattened tops of the wedges used in experiments are also considered in the calculations. It is then demonstrated that the effective shift for the sphere motion is the average of the shifts for shear flows in the two perpendicular directions. A good agreement is found between theory and experiment.},

We considered all possible arrangements of the two cylinders in terms of the distance between the two cylinders and the inclination angle of the line connecting the cylinder centers with respect to the direction of the main flow. Ten distinct flow patterns were identified in total based on vorticity contours and streamlines, which are Steady, Near-Steady, Base-Bleed, Biased-Base-Bleed, Shear-Layer-Reattachment, Induced-Separation, Vortex-Impingement, Flip-Flopping, Modulated Periodic, and Synchronized-Vortex-Shedding. Collecting all the numerical results obtained, we propose a general flow-pattern diagram for each Re, and a contour diagram on vortex-shedding frequency for each cylinder at Re=100. The perfect symmetry implied in the geometrical configuration allows one to use these diagrams to identify flow pattern and vortex-shedding frequencies in the presence of two circular cylinders of equal diameter arbitrarily positioned in physical space with respect to the main-flow direction.},

  abstract = {It is now well-known that the wake transition regime for a circular cylinder involves two modes of small-scale three-dimensional instability, modes ``A'' and ``B'', occurring in different Reynolds number ranges. These modes are quite distinct in spanwise lengthscale and in symmetry, and they are found to scale on different physical features of the flow. Mode A has a large spanwise wavelength of around 3\textendash 4 cylinder diameters, and scales on the larger physical structure in the flow, namely the core of the primary K\'arm\'an vortices. The feedback from one vortex to the next gives an out-of-phase streamwise vortex pattern for this mode. In contrast, the mode B instability has a distinctly smaller spanwise wevelength (1 diameter) which scales on the smaller physical structure in the flow, namely the braid shear layer. The symmetry of mode B is determined by the reverse flow behind the bluff cylinder, leading to a system of streamwise vortices which are in phase between successive half cycles. The symmetries of both modes are the same as the ones found in the vortex system evolving from perturbed plane wakes studied by Meiburg and Lasheras (1988) and Lasheras and Meiburg (1990). Furthermore, the question of the physical origin of these three-dimensional instabilities is addressed. We present evidence that they are linked to general instability mechanisms found in two-dimensional linear flows. In particular, mode A seems to be a result of an elliptic instability of the near-wake vortex cores; predictions based on elliptic instability theory concerning the initial perturbation shape and the spanwise wevelength are in good agreement with experimental observations. For the mode B instability, it is suggested that it is a manifestation of a hyperbolic instability of the stagnation point flow found in the braid shear layer linking the primary vortices.},

The parameters are the running distance before impact and the sphere Reynolds number. For running lengths less than 7.5 diameters, the sphere wake before impact is axisymmetric in the form of an attached vortex ring. After impact, this ring overtakes the sphere and spreads out along the wall. For Reynolds numbers below 1000, the flow remains axisymmetric at all times. For higher values, perturbations of azimuthal wavenumbers 20\textendash 25 are observed on the vortex ring, leading to a breakdown of the flow. We analyse different hypotheses concerning the origin of this instability, with the conclusion that a centrifugal instability mechanism is likely to be acting in this flow. Comparisons are made with the flow involving an isolated vortex ring approaching a wall. Numerical simulations of this case have revealed that two distinct instability mechanisms are operating, one of which appears to be similar to the centrifugal instability observed for the sphere impact.},

This symmetry group describes, for example, two-dimensional time-periodic flows past bodies which have reflection symmetry across a wake center plane, such as symmetrical airfoils, circular and square cylinders. Normal form analysis of these systems is based on a joint representation of the monodromy matrix for the half-period-flip map (a composition of a half-period temporal evolution with a spatial reflection) and the spatial O(2) symmetry. There are exactly two kinds of codimension-one synchronous bifurcations in these systems; one preserves the Z2 spatio-temporal symmetry, while the other breaks it. When the Floquet multipliers occur in complex-conjugate pairs (non-resonant with the periodic basic state), there is a single codimension-one bifurcation, and at the bifurcation point two different kind of solutions appear simultaneously: a pair of modulated traveling waves, and a circle of modulated standing waves. At most one of these two types has stable solutions. The symmetries of the system also admit period-doubling bifurcations, but these are codimension-two and the normal form analysis permits specific conclusions regarding these. There are also a number of other codimension-two bifurcations leading to mixed modes and the strong 1:1 and 1:2 resonances. All the codimension-one bifurcations are illustrated with reference to a concrete physical example.},

  abstract = {A general theoretical formalism is developed to assess how base-flow modifications may alter the stability properties of flows studied in a global approach of linear stability theory. It also comprises a systematic approach to the passive control of globally unstable flows by the use of small control devices. This formalism is based on a sensitivity analysis of any global eigenvalue to base-flow modifications. The base-flow modifications investigated are either arbitrary or specific ones induced by a steady force. This leads to a definition of the so-called sensitivity to base-flow modifications and sensitivity to a steady force. These sensitivity analyses are applied to the unstable global modes responsible for the onset of vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder for Reynolds numbers in the range 47{$\leq$}Re{$\leq$}80. First, it is demonstrated how the sensitivity to arbitrary base-flow modifications may be used to identify regions and properties of the base flow that contribute to the onset of vortex shedding. Secondly, the sensitivity to a steady force determines the regions of the flow where a steady force acting on the base flow stabilizes the unstable global modes. Upon modelling the presence of a control device by a steady force acting on the base flow, these predictions are then extensively compared with the experimental results of Strykowski \& Sreenivasan (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 218, 1990, p. 71). A physical interpretation of the suppression of vortex shedding by use of a control cylinder is proposed in the light of the sensitivity analysis.},

This stepwise variation disappears for natural shedding at Reynolds number higher than approximately 2000; however, it is present at the higher Reynolds numbers for the acoustically perturbed case. The present experimental study shows that if the flow is forced by small transverse oscillations, similar in form to the resonant transverse acoustic mode, the leading-edge and trailing-edge vortex shedding are locked over a wide range of forcing frequencies. However, a stepwise variation in the frequency at which peak base drag occurs is found even at these higher Reynolds numbers. The stepwise frequency variation of vortex shedding in the natural shedding case and the acoustic resonance case are then explained in terms of preference of the flow to shed trailing-edge vortices at peak base drag.},

The transverse perturbations, analogous to {$\beta$}-mode duct acoustic resonances, are generated through harmonic oscillations of the sidewalls. When this occurs, the leading-edge vortices are found always to pass the trailing edge at the same phase in the perturbation cycle regardless of the chord-to-thickness (c/t) ratio. Applying perturbations at an Stp not equal to the natural global frequency also results in phase-locked vortex shedding from the leading edge, and a near wake with a frequency equal to the perturbation frequency. This is consistent with previous experimental findings. However, vortex shedding at the trailing edge is either weaker or non-existent. PIV results and flow visualization showed trailing-edge vortex growth was weaker because leading-edge vortices arrive at the trailing edge at a phase in the perturbation cycle where they interfere with trailing-edge shedding. The frequencies at which trailing-edge vortices form for different c/t ratios correspond to the natural ILEV/TEVS frequencies. As in the case of natural shedding, peaks in base suction occur when the leading-edge vortices pass the trailing edge at the phase in the perturbation cycle (and thus in the leading-edge shedding cycle) that allows strong trailing-edge shedding. This is the reason for the similarity in the St vs. c/t relationship for three seemingly different sets of experiments.},

  abstract = {It has been observed by researchers in the past that vortex shedding behind circular cylinders can be altered, and in some cases suppressed, over a limited range of Reynolds numbers by proper placement of a second, much smaller, `control' cylinder in the near wake of the main cylinder. Results are presented for numerical computations of some such situations. A stabilized finite element method is employed to solve the incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations in the primitive variables formulation. At low Reynolds numbers, for certain relative positions of the main and control cylinder, the vortex shedding from the main cylinder is completely suppressed. Excellent agreement is observed between the present computations and experimental findings of other researchers. In an effort to explain the mechanism of control of vortex shedding, the streamwise variation of the pressure coefficient close to the shear layer of the main cylinder is compared for various cases, with and without the control cylinder. In the cases where the vortex shedding is suppressed, it is observed that the control cylinder provides a local favorable pressure gradient in the wake region, thereby stabilizing the shear layer locally.

This implies the general study of the temporal evolution of global modes, which are time-harmonic solutions of the linear disturbance equations, subject to homogeneous boundary conditions in all space directions. Flow domains of both doubly infinite and semi-infinite streamwise extent are considered and complete solutions are obtained within the framework of asymptotically matched WKBJ approximations. In both cases the global eigenfrequency is given, to leading order in the WKBJ parameter, by the absolute frequency {$\omega$}0(Xt) at the dominant turning point Xt of the WKBJ approximation, while its quantization is provided by the connection of solutions across Xt. Within the context of the present analysis, global modes can therefore only become time-amplified or self-excited if the basic flow contains a region of absolute instability.},

Particle image velocimetry was used to locate the highest concentration of fluctuations in the velocity field and subsequent hot-wire measurements at those locations provided adequate spectral resolution to follow the evolution of various instabilities that are active within the separated shear layer. Similar to recent findings by this same group, the shear layer behaviour is observed to contain a combination of Reynolds invariant characteristics, including its time-averaged position, while other properties demonstrate clear Reynolds number dependency, including the spatial amplification of turbulent kinetic energy. Additional results here show that the ratio of side lengths of the body is a key parameter in revealing these effects. One reason for this is the level of coupling between modes of instability, which is evaluated using two-point correlation methods. These findings indicate that the separated shear layer on a bluff body is highly nonlinear. A specific set of scales responsible for these unique behaviours is identified and discussed, along with their relationship to other scales in the flow.},

Separation of the eigenvalues interesting for the flow stability analysis is performed with the inverse Cayley transformation.

  abstract = {The wakes behind cylinders having an equilateral triangular cross-section are studied numerically for various cylinder inclinations and Reynolds numbers. For steady flows, the development of the recirculation region near the onset of flow separation is described, and the separation Reynolds numbers mapped for different cylinder inclinations. Cylinder inclinations that are not reflection symmetric about the horizontal centreline produce asymmetric recirculation regions which persist until the flow becomes unstable. Flow separation is observed to initiate on the rear-face of the cylinder and develops in size with increasing Reynolds numbers until the separation points become defined at the triangular cross-section's vertices where they remain even at higher Reynolds numbers. Using the Stuart\textendash Landau equation, the critical Reynolds numbers of the different flow cases are quantified. The inclination of the cylinder is seen to strongly affect the location of the separation points, the dimensions of the recirculation region, and ultimately the critical Reynolds numbers. Increasing the Reynolds number past the instability threshold, a B\'enard\textendash von K\'arm\'anvortex street is initially observed before the downstream region of the wake re-aligns to a bi-layered vortex structure. Beyond this regime, the vortex street is observed to develop variously. At most cylinder inclinations ({$\alpha<$}30\textdegree{} and {$\alpha\greaterequivlnt$}42\textdegree ), the bi-layered wake re-assembles into a secondary vortex street further downstream. For a small range of cylinder inclinations (30\textdegree{$\leq\alpha\lessequivlnt$}38\textdegree ), the shedding vortices interact to form a vortex street similar to that produced by the 2P shedding mode for oscillating circular cylinders, while inclinations 38\textdegree{$\lessequivlnt\alpha<$}54\textdegree{} describe the development of a P+S-like vortex street. The formation of these unsteady wakes are attributed to vortex interactions in the wake. The drag and lift force coefficients for various cylinder inclinations and Reynolds numbers are also summarised. Phase trajectories of the force coefficients reveal that the transition from the bi-layered wake to the 2P-like wake alters its profile significantly, while the transitions to the other vortex streets observed did not incur such changes.},

For the cylinder with end-plates, on which the oil flow patterns were observed to be essentially two-dimensional, the drag rapidly decreased as  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$} h/d  decreased to less than 0.5 but became constant for  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$} h/d  of less than 0.35, unlike that usually observed near a fixed ground. This critical drag behavior was found to be directly related to a global change in the near wake structure of the cylinder; as  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$} h/d  decreased the K\'arm\'an-type vortex shedding became intermittent at  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$}=0.4 h/d=0.4 , and then totally ceased and instead two nearly parallel shear layers were formed behind the cylinder at  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$}=0.3 h/d=0.3  and below. For the cylinder without end-plates, however, no such critical change in drag was observed as the K\'arm\'an-type vortices were not generated in the near wake region at all  {$\Planckconst$}/{$\mathsl{d}$} h/d  investigated. Based on the experimental results obtained, further discussions are also given to the essential cause of the cessation of the K\'arm\'an vortex shedding in the ground effect.},

  abstract = {Linear stability analysis (LSA) is applied to the mean flow of an oscillating round jet with the aim of investigating the robustness and accuracy of mean flow stability wave models. The jet's axisymmetric mode is excited at the nozzle lip through a sinusoidal modulation of the flow rate at amplitudes ranging from 0.1 \% to 100 \%. The instantaneous flow field is measured via particle image velocimetry (PIV) and decomposed into a mean and periodic part utilizing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Local LSA is applied to the measured mean flow adopting a weakly non-parallel flow approach. The resulting global perturbation field is carefully compared with the measurements in terms of spatial growth rate, phase velocity, and phase and amplitude distribution. It is shown that the stability wave model accurately predicts the excited flow oscillations during their entire growth phase and during a large part of their decay phase. The stability wave model applies over a wide range of forcing amplitudes, showing no pronounced sensitivity to the strength of nonlinear saturation. The upstream displacement of the neutral point and the successive reduction of gain with increasing forcing amplitude is very well captured by the stability wave model. At very strong forcing ( ), the flow becomes essentially stable to the axisymmetric mode. For these extreme cases, the prediction deteriorates from the measurements due to an interaction of the forced wave with the geometric confinement of the nozzle. Moreover, the model fails far downstream in a region where energy is transferred from the oscillation back to the mean flow. This study supports previously conducted mean flow stability analysis of self-excited flow oscillations in the cylinder wake and in the vortex breakdown bubble and extends the methodology to externally forced convectively unstable flows. The high accuracy of mean flow stability wave models as demonstrated here is of great importance for the analysis of coherent structures in turbulent shear flows.},

  abstract = {Instabilities in the flow past a rounded square cylinder have been numerically studied in order to clarify the effects of rounding the sharp edges of a square cylinder on the primary and secondary instabilities associated with the flow. Rounding the edges was done by inscribing a quarter circle of radius  rr  in each edge of a square cylinder of height  dd . Nine cases of rounding were considered, ranging from a square cylinder ( r/d=0r/d=0 ) to a circular cylinder ( r/d=0.5r/d=0.5 ) with an increment of 0.0625. Each cross-section was numerically implemented in a Cartesian grid system by using an immersed boundary method. The key parameters are the Reynolds number (Re) and the edge-radius ratio ( r/dr/d ). For low Re, the flow is steady and symmetric with respect to the centreline. Over the first critical Reynolds number ( Rec1Re\_\{c1\} ), the flow undergoes a Hopf bifurcation to a time-periodic flow, termed the primary instability. As Re further increases, the onset of the secondary instability of three-dimensional (3D) nature is detected beyond the second critical Reynolds number ( Rec2Re\_\{c2\} ). Rounding the sharp edges of a square cylinder significantly affects the flow topology, leading to noticeable changes in both instabilities. By employing the Stuart\textendash Landau equation, we investigated the criticality of the primary instability depending upon  r/dr/d . The onset of the 3D secondary instability was detected by using Floquet stability analysis. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the dominant modes (A, B, QP) were described. The neutral stability curves of each mode were computed depending upon~ r/dr/d .},

The first class is subharmonic, and corresponds to pairing or localized pairing of vortex tubes; the pairing instability is most unstable in the two-dimensional limit, in which the perturbation has no spanwise variations. The second class repeats in the streamwise direction with the same periodicity as the basic flow. This mode is most unstable for spanwise wavelengths approximately 2/3 of the space between vortex centres, and can lead to the generation of streamwise vorticity and coherent ridges of upwelling. Comparison is made between the calculated instabilities and the observed pairing, helical pairing, and streak transitions.

This approach is compared with the analysis of the perturbation kinetic energy production, a classic approach in linear stability analysis. Multiple steady-state solutions are found at high rotation rates, explaining the quenching of the second shedding mode. Turning points in phase space are associated with the movement of the flow stagnation point. In addition, a method to examine which structural variation of the base flow has the largest impact on the instability features is proposed. This has relevant implications for the passive control of instabilities. Finally, numerical simulations of the flow are performed to verify that the structural sensitivity analysis is able to provide correct indications on where to position passive control devices, e.g. small obstacles, in order to suppress the shedding modes.},

  abstract = {Results are presented for a numerical simulation of vortex-induced vibrations of a circular cylinder of low non-dimensional mass (m* = 10) in the laminar flow regime (60 {$<$} Re {$<$} 200). The natural structural frequency of the oscillator, fN, matches the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder at Re = 100. This corresponds to fN D2/{$\nu$} = 16.6, where D is the diameter of the cylinder and {$\nu$} the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid. A stabilized space\textendash time finite element formulation is utilized to solve the incompressible flow equations in primitive variables form in two dimensions. Unlike at high Re, where the cylinder response is known to be associated with three branches, at low Re only two branches are identified: `initial' and `lower'. For a blockage of 2.5\% and less the onset of synchronization, in the lower Re range, is accompanied by an intermittent switching between two modes with vortex shedding occurring at different frequencies. With higher blockage the jump from the initial to lower branch is hysteretic. Results from free vibrations are compared to the data from experiments for forced vibrations reported earlier. Excellent agreement is observed for the critical amplitude required for the onset of synchronization. The comparison brings out the possibility of hysteresis in forced vibrations. The phase difference between the lift force and transverse displacement shows a jump of almost 180\textdegree{} at, approximately, the middle of the synchronization region. This jump is not hysteretic and it is not associated with any radical change in the vortex shedding pattern. Instead, it is caused by changes in the location and value of the maximum suction on the lower and upper surface of the cylinder. This is observed clearly by comparing the time-averaged flow for a vibrating cylinder for different Re. While the mean flow for Re beyond the phase jump is similar to that for a stationary cylinder, it is associated with a pair of counter-rotating vortices in the near wake for Re prior to the phase jump. The phase jump appears to be one of the mechanisms of the oscillator to self-limit its vibration amplitude.},

  abstract = {Results are presented for flow-induced vibrations of a pair of equal-sized circular cylinders of low nondimensional mass (m*=10) in a tandem arrangement. The cylinders are free to oscillate both in streamwise and transverse directions. The Reynolds number, based on the free-stream speed and the diameter of the cylinders, D is 100 and the centre-to-centre distance between the cylinders is 5.5D. The computations are carried out for reduced velocities in the range 2{$\leq$}U*{$\leq$}15. The structural damping is set to zero for enabling maximum amplitudes of oscillation. A stabilized finite element method is utilized to carry out the computations in two dimensions. Even though the response of the upstream cylinder is found to be qualitatively similar to that of an isolated cylinder, the presence of a downstream cylinder is found to have significant effect on the behaviour of the upstream cylinder. The downstream cylinder undergoes very large amplitude of oscillations in both transverse and streamwise directions. The maximum amplitude of transverse response of the downstream cylinder is quite similar to that of a single cylinder at higher Re beyond the laminar regime. Lock-in and hysteresis are observed for both upstream and downstream cylinders. The downstream cylinder undergoes large amplitude oscillations even beyond the lock-in state. The phase between transverse oscillations and lift force suffers a 180{$\circ$} jump for both the cylinders almost in the middle of the synchronization regime. The phase between the transverse response of the two cylinders is also studied. Complex flow patterns are observed in the wake of the freely vibrating cylinders. Based on the phase difference and the flow patterns, the entire flow range is divided into five sub-regions.},

Increased forward rotation triggers three-dimensionality at increasingly lower Reynolds numbers, while reverse rotation delays this transition to much higher values.

The second and previously unknown transition involves a loss of planar symmetry and a low-frequency lateral oscillation of the wake, exhibiting a surprising 7:3 resonance with the hairpin vortex shedding. The two transitions are characterized by dye visualizations and quantitative information obtained from numerical simulations, such as force coefficients and wake frequencies (Strouhal numbers). Both transitions are found to be supercritical. Further increasing the Reynolds number, the flow becomes progressively more disorganized and chaotic. Overall, the transition sequence for the rolling sphere is closer to the one for a non-rotating sphere in a free stream than to that of a non-rotating sphere close to a wall.},

The initial transition from steady two-dimensional flow can occur through either a Hopf bifurcation to unsteady flow or through a regular bifurcation to steady three-dimensional flow. The critical Reynolds numbers for each case are determined as a function of gap height. It is found that steady two- to three-dimensional transition occurs first at gap ratios G/D{$\lessequivlnt$}0.25, beyond which the initial transition is to unsteady flow. At G/D=0.3, a sharp increase in the critical Reynolds number is observed at which three-dimensionality occurs.

  abstract = {Linear stability analysis of a wide range of two-dimensional and axisymmetric bluff-body wakes shows that the first three-dimensional mode to became unstable is always mode~E. From the studies presented in this paper, it is speculated to be the universal primary 3D instability, irrespective of the flow configuration. However, since it is a transition from a steady two-dimensional flow, whether this mode can be observed in practice does depend on the nature of the flow set-up. For example, the mode~E transition of a circular cylinder wake occurs at a Reynolds number of                                                                Re{$\simeq$}96Re{$\simeq$}96\textbackslash mathit\{Re\}\textbackslash simeq 96                                   , which is considerably higher than the steady to unsteady Hopf bifurcation at                                                                Re{$\simeq$}46Re{$\simeq$}46\textbackslash mathit\{Re\}\textbackslash simeq 46                                    leading to B\'enard\textendash von-K\'arm\'an shedding. On the other hand, if the absolute instability responsible for the latter transition is suppressed, by rotating the cylinder or moving it towards a wall, then mode~E may become the first transition of the steady flow. A well-known example is flow over a backward-facing step, where this instability is the first global instability to be manifested on the otherwise two-dimensional steady flow. Many other examples are considered in this paper. Exploring this further, a structural stability analysis (Pralits et~al.                 J.~Fluid Mech., vol.~730, 2013, pp.~5\textendash 18) was conducted for the subset of flows past a rotating cylinder as the rotation rate was varied. For the non-rotating or slowly rotating case, this indicated that the growth rate of the instability mode was sensitive to forcing between the recirculation lobes, while for the rapidly rotating case, it confirmed sensitivity near the cylinder and towards the hyperbolic point. For the non-rotating case, the perturbation, adjoint and structural stability fields, together with the wavelength selection, show some similarities with those of a Crow instability of a counter-rotating vortex pair, at least within the recirculation zones. On the other hand, at much higher rotation rates, Pralits et~al. (J.~Fluid Mech., vol.~730, 2013, pp.~5\textendash 18) have suggested that hyperbolic instability may play a role. However, both instabilities lie on the same continuous solution branch in Reynolds number/rotation-rate parameter space. The results suggest that this particular flow transition at least, and probably others, may have a number of different physical mechanisms supporting their development.},

Different values of the edge radius of curvature are considered, in a range such that they might reasonably be ascribed to manufacturing tolerances. A stochastic approach is adopted in order to build response curves of the quantities of interest as a function of the radius of curvature. The considered computational set-up, characterized by a fine numerical resolution and a low subgrid-scale (SGS) dissipation, predicts for the body having perfectly sharp edges a short mean recirculation length on the cylinder side, in disagreement with experimental data. On the other hand, even for the smallest considered radius of curvature, the length of the mean recirculation region increases significantly and, hence, the agreement with the experimental data is much improved. It is observed that the sharp edge introduces a higher level of turbulent fluctuations in the shear-layer at separation, which, if not artificially damped by numerical or SGS dissipation, grows faster and leads to a further upstream roll-up of the shear-layers and, hence, to a shorter mean recirculation region than in simulations with rounded edges.},

These results suggest that the transition scenario for elongated bluff bodies may be distinctly different to short bodies such as circular or square cylinders. At the very least, the dominant spanwise wavelength in the turbulent wake is likely to be much longer than that for a circular cylinder wake. In addition, the reversal of the ordering of occurrence of the two modes with the different spatial symmetries is likely to affect the development of spatio-temporal chaos as a precursor to fully turbulent flow.In conjunction with prior work, the current results indicate that nearly all three-dimensional instabilities of the vortex street can be identified as one of only a handful of transition modes.},

Because of its central role in many research efforts involving fluid flow, stability theory has grown into a mature discipline, firmly based on a large body of knowledge and a vast body of literature. The sheer size of this field has made it difficult for young researchers to access this exciting area of fluid dynamics. For this reason, writing a book on the subject of hydrodynamic stability theory and transition is a daunting endeavor, especially as any book on stability theory will have to follow into the footsteps of the classical treatises by Lin (1955), Betchov \& Criminale (1967), Joseph (1971), and Drazin \& Reid (1981). Each of these books has marked an important development in stability theory and has laid the foundation for many researchers to advance our understanding of stability and transition in shear flows.},

Different control measures, such as wake heating, transverse body oscillations and base bleed are investigated. As the steady-periodic K\'arm\'an shedding has previously been identified as a limit-cycle, i.e. as self-excited oscillations, the experiments are interpreted in the framework of the Stuart\textendash Landau model. The coefficients of the Stuart\textendash Landau equation for the characteristic vortex shedding amplitude, i.e. the linear temporal growth rate, linear frequency and the Landau constant, are fully determined for the two cylinders and in part for the plate. For this purpose transients are generated by suddenly switching transverse body oscillations or base bleed on or off. The analysis of these transients by a refined method based on complex demodulation provides reliable estimates of the model coefficients and yields an experimental validation of the concept that a global instability mode grows or decays as a whole. Also, it is demonstrated that the coefficients of the Stuart\textendash Landau equation are independent of the experimental technique used to produce the transients.},

Three-dimensional instability modes are predicted and computed using a linear stability analysis technique and three-dimensional simulations, respectively. Depending on the incidence angle, the flow is found to transition to three-dimensional flow through either a mode A instability, or a subharmonic mode C instability. The mode A instability is predicted as the first-occurring instability at incidence angles smaller than 12\textdegree{} and greater than 26\textdegree, with the mode C instability predicted between these incidence angles. At a zero-degree angle of incidence, the wake instabilities closely match modes A, B and a quasi-periodic mode predicted in earlier studies behind square and circular cylinders. With increasing angle of incidence, the three-dimensional wake transition Reynolds number first increases from Re = 164 as the mode A instability weakens, before decreasing again beyond an incidence angle of 12\textdegree{} as the wake becomes increasingly unstable to the mode C instability, and then again to the mode A instability as the incidence angle approaches 45\textdegree. A spanwise autocorrelation analysis from computations over a cylinder span 20 times the square cross-section side length reveals that beyond the onset of three-dimensional instabilities, the vortex street breaks down with patterns consistent with spatio-temporal chaos. This effect was more pronounced at higher incidence angles.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the first Hopf bifurcation of a cylinder flow, and more particularly with the properties of the unsteady periodic K\'arm\'an vortex street regime that sets in for supercritical Reynolds numbers Re \&gt; 46. Barkley (Europhys. Lett. vol.75, 2006, p. 750) has recently studied the linear properties of the associated mean flow, i.e. the flow which is obtained by a time average of this unsteady periodic flow. He observed, thanks to a global mode analysis, that the mean flow is marginally stable and that the eigenfrequencies associated with the global modes of the mean flow fit the Strouhal to Reynolds experimental function well in the range 46 \&lt; Re \&lt; 180. The aim of this article is to give a theoretical proof of this result near the bifurcation. For this, we do a global weakly nonlinear analysis valid in the vicinity of the critical Reynolds number Rec based on the small parameter {$\epsilon$} = Rec-1 - Re-1 {$\ll$} 1. We compute numerically the complex constants {$\lambda$} and {$\mu{'}$} which appear in the Stuart-Landau amplitude equation: dA/dt = {$\epsilon$} {$\lambda$}A - {$\epsilon\mu{'}$} A|A|2. Here A is the scalar complex amplitude of the critical global mode. By analysing carefully the nonlinear interactions yielding the term {$\mu{'}$}, we show for the cylinder flow that the mean flow is approximately marginally stable and that the linear dynamics of the mean flow yields the frequency of the saturated Stuart-Landau limit cycle. We will finally show that these results are not general, by studying the case of the bifurcation of an open cavity flow. In particular, we show that the mean flow in this case remains strongly unstable and that the frequencies associated with the eigenmodes do not exactly match those of the nonlinear unsteady periodic cavity flow. It will be demonstrated that two precise conditions must hold for a linear stability analysis of a mean flow to be relevant and useful.},

The effect of the cylinder spacing, in the range G = 0.3D to 12D, was also studied for selected Reynolds numbers, that is, Re = 130, 150 and 500. An incompressible finite volume code with a collocated grid arrangement was employed to carry out the flow simulations. Instantaneous and time-averaged and spanwise-averaged vorticity, pressure, and streamlines are computed and compared for different Reynolds numbers and gap spacings. The time averaged global quantities such as the Strouhal number, the mean and the RMS values of the drag force, the base suction pressure, the lift force and the pressure coefficient are also calculated and compared with the results of a single cylinder. Three major regimes are distinguished according to the normalized gap spacing between cylinders, that is, the single slender-body regime (G {$<$} 0.5), the reattach regime (G {$<$} 4) and co-shedding or binary vortex regime (G {$\geq$}4). Hysteresis with different vortex patterns is observed in a certain range of the gap spacings and also for the onset of the vortex shedding. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The Reynolds numbers are low (Re=45\textendash 200) so that the flow is presumably laminar. A von K\'arm\'an vortex sheet is predicted behind the cylinders with a periodicity which agrees well with experiments. An incompressible SIMPLEC code is used with a non-staggered grid arrangement. A third-order QUICK scheme is used for the convective terms. The time discretization is implicit and a second-order Crank\textendash Nicolson scheme is employed. At the outlet of the computational domain a convective Sommerfeld boundary condition is compared with a traditional Neumann condition. The convective boundary condition is shown to be more effective in reducing the CPU time, reducing the upstream influence of the outlet and thus reducing the necessary downstream extent of the domain. A study of the effects of spatial resolution and blockage is also provided. The onset of vortex shedding is investigated by using the Stuart\textendash Landau equation at various angles of incidence and for a solid blockage of 5\%. A number of quantities such as Strouhal number and drag, lift and moment coefficients are calculated. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A study investigating the flow around a cylinder rolling or sliding on a wall has been undertaken in two and three dimensions. The cylinder motion is specified from a set of five discrete rotation rates, ranging from prograde through to retrograde rolling. A Reynolds number range of 20\textendash 500 is considered. The effects of the nearby wall and the imposed body motion on the wake structure and dominant wake transitions have been determined. Prograde rolling is shown to destabilize the wake flow, while retrograde rotation delays the onset of unsteady flow to Reynolds numbers well above those observed for a cylinder in an unbounded flow.Two-dimensional simulations show the presence of two recirculation zones in the steady wake, the lengths of which increase approximately linearly with the Reynolds number. Values of the lift and drag coefficient are also reported for the steady flow regime. Results from a linear stability analysis show that the wake initially undergoes a regular bifurcation from a steady two-dimensional flow to a steady three-dimensional wake for all rotation rates. The critical Reynolds number Rec of transition and the spanwise wavelength of the dominant mode are shown to be highly dependent on, but smoothly varying with, the rotation rate of the cylinder. Varying the rotation from prograde to retrograde rolling acts to increase the value of Rec and decrease the preferred wavelength. The structure of the fully evolved wake mode is then established through three-dimensional simulations. In fact it is found that at Reynolds numbers only marginally (\textasciitilde 5\%) above critical, the three-dimensional simulations indicate that the saturated state becomes time dependent, although at least initially, this does not result in a significant change to the mode structure. It is only at higher Reynolds numbers that the wake undergoes a transition to vortex shedding.An analysis of the three-dimensional transition indicates that it is unlikely to be due to a centrifugal instability despite the superficial similarity to the flow over a backward-facing step, for which the transition mechanism has been speculated to be centrifugal. However, the attached elongated recirculation region and distribution of the spanwise perturbation vorticity field, and the similarity of these features with those of the flow through a partially blocked channel, suggest the possibility that the mechanism is elliptic in nature. Some analysis which supports this conjecture is undertaken.},

  abstract = {A numerical and experimental investigation is reported for the flow around a rolling sphere when moving adjacent to a plane wall. The dimensionless rotation rate of the sphere is varied from forward to reversed rolling and the resulting wake modes are found to be strongly dependent on the value of this parameter. Results are reported for the Reynolds number range 100 {$<$} Re {$<$} 350, which has been shown to capture the unsteady transitions in the wake. Over this range of Reynolds number, both steady and unsteady wake modes are observed. As the sphere undergoes forward rolling, the wake displays similarities to the flow behind an isolated sphere in a free stream. As the Reynolds number of the flow increases, hairpin vortices form and are shed over the surface of the sphere. However, for cases with reversed rotation, the wake takes the form of two distinct streamwise vortices that form around the sides of the body. These streamwise structures in the wake undergo a transition to a new unsteady mode as the Reynolds number increases. During the evolution of this unsteady mode, the streamwise vortices form an out-of-phase spiral pair. Four primary wake modes are identified and a very good qualitative agreement is observed between the numerical and experimental results. The numerical simulations also reveal the existence of an additional unsteady mode that is found to be unstable to small perturbations in the flow.},

These plates generate {$\beta$}-mode acoustic resonances over several discrete ranges of flow velocity. A potential flow model for a plate with a square leading edge is developed and the acoustic power generated by vortices, which grow and shed from the leading edge, is calculated as they move through the resonant acoustic field. Vortices grow rapidly during the first half cycle and the vortex growth rate is quantified by using a Kutta condition. This model indicates that a major phase-dependent sound soccurs when a vortex passes the trailing edge of the plate. It is the remoteness of this source from the site at the leading edge where the sound affects the flow which makes possible the discrete resonance ranges.},

  abstract = {Vortex `shedding' behind circular cylinders can be altered and suppressed altogether (or `controlled') over a limited range of Reynolds numbers, by a proper placement of a second, much smaller, cylinder in the near wake of the main cylinder. This new and dramatic suppression of vortex `shedding' is the subject of this paper. Details of the phenomenon are documented through parallel experimental and numerical investigations, including flow visualization. Temporal growth rate measurements of the velocity fluctuations reveal that the presence of the smaller cylinder reduces the growth rate of the disturbances leading to vortex `shedding', and that its suppression, accompanied by the disappearance of sharp spectral peaks, coincides with negative temporal growth rates. It is argued that the presence of the secondary cylinder has the effect of altering the local stability of the flow by smearing and diffusing concentrated vorticity in the shear layers behind the body; a related effect is that the secondary cylinder diverts a small amount of fluid into the wake of the main cylinder. A unified explanation of the formation and suppression of the vortex street is attempted, and it is suggested that the vortex `shedding' is associated with temporally unstable eigenmodes which are heavily weighted by the near field. It is also shown that absolute instability is relevant, up to a point, in explaining vortex shedding, whose suppression can similarly be associated with altering the instability in the near wake region from absolute to convective.},

  abstract = {In the first part of the paper, a mixing layer of tanh y form is considered, and twodimensional solutions of the non-linear inviscid equations are found representing periodic perturbations from the neutral wave of linearized stability theory. To second order in amplitude the solutions are equivalent to the equilibrium state calculated by Schade (1964), who studied the development of perturbations in time and found an evolution towards that equilibrium state. The present calculation, however, is taken to fourth-order in amplitude. It is noted that the solutions presented in this paper are regular, even though viscosity is ignored; and the relationships to the singular (if inviscid) time-dependent solutions of Schade are explained. Such regular, inviscid solutions have been found only for odd velocity profiles, such as tanh y.Although the details of the velocity distributions are not of the form observed experimentally, it is shown that the amplitude ratios of fundamental and first harmonic, for a given absolute amplitude, are comparable with those observed.In part 2 some exact non-linear solutions are presented of the inviscid, incompressible equations of fluid flow in two or three spatial dimensions. They illustrate the flows of part 1, since they are periodic in one co-ordinate (x), have a shear in another (y) and are independent of the third. Included, as two-dimensional cases, are (i) the tanh y velocity distribution for a flow wholly in the x-direction, (ii) the well-known solution for the flow due to a set of point vortices equi-spaced on the axis, and (iii) an example of linearized hydrodynamic (Orr-Sommerfeld) stability theory. The flows may involve concentrations of vorticity. In three-dimensional cases the z component of velocity is even in y, whereas the x component is odd. Consequently, the class of flows represents, in general, small or large periodic perturbations from a skewed shear layer. Time-dependent solutions, representing waves travelling in the x direction may be obtained by translation of axes.},

This paper reviews the current understanding of the flow around two ``infinite'' circular cylinders of equal diameter immersed in a steady cross-flow, with a focus on the near-wake flow patterns, Reynolds number effects, intermediate wake structure and behaviour, and the general trends in the measurements of the aerodynamic force coefficients and Strouhal numbers.

Simulations with a small amplitude crossflow oscillatory forcing also exhibit a similar receptivity at these Strouhal numbers. This is demonstrated by Strouhal number stepping corresponding to local maxima of base suction as the plate aspect ratio is varied.

  abstract = {The flow at low Reynolds number around rectangular cylinders of varying chord-to-thickness ratios under transverse periodic forcing is studied numerically. Although of relatively low amplitude, the forcing locks the shedding from both the leading and trailing edges to the applied frequency. The base suction, and the lift and the drag on the cylinders are found to be complex functions of the forcing frequency. At low Reynolds numbers and without applied forcing, the flow is controlled by a global instability with the leading- and trailing-edge shedding locked; moreover, the reduced frequency of shedding varies in a stepwise manner with the chord-to-thickness ratio. This global instability is still evident in the flows under external forcing examined in this paper. While previous researchers have conjectured that the trailing-edge shedding plays a dominant role in the preferred frequency selection in the natural shedding case, the important role of trailing-edge shedding when the flow is forced is confirmed in the present study. In particular, the individual contributions from leading- and trailing-edge vortices on the perturbation to the leading-edge shear layer are examined. In addition, it is shown that the base suction is maximum when the forcing frequency is close to the global instability frequency observed in unforced flows, thereby strengthening the argument that the unforced, forced, and duct resonant cases are strongly influenced by the same global instability. The variations of the lift, drag and formation length with chord-to-thickness ratio are quantified.},

To date it has dealt successfully with a wide range of applications arising in aerospace engineering, physiological flows, food processing, and nuclear-reactor safety. In recent years, nonmodal analysis has complemented the more traditional modal approach and increased knowledge of flow instability physics. Recent highlights delivered by the application of either modal or nonmodal global analysis are briefly discussed. A conscious effort is made to demystify both the tools currently utilized and the jargon employed to describe them, demonstrating the simplicity of the analysis. Hopefully this will provide new impulses for the creation of next-generation algorithms capable of coping with the main open research areas in which step-change progress can be expected by the application of the theory: instability analysis of fully inhomogeneous, 3D flows and control thereof.},

  abstract = {Previous experimental studies have shown that the steady recirculation bubble that forms as the flow separates at the leading-edge corner of a long plate, becomes unsteady at relatively low Reynolds numbers of only a few hundreds. The reattaching shear layer irregularly releases two-dimensional vortices, which quickly undergo three-dimensional transition. Similar to the flow over a backward-facing step, this flow is globally stable at such Reynolds numbers, with transition to a steady three-dimensional flow as the first global instability to occur as the Reynolds number is increased to 393. Hence, it appears that the observed flow behaviour is governed by transient growth of optimal two-dimensional transiently growing perturbations (constructed from damped global modes) rather than a single three-dimensional unstable global mode. This paper quantifies the details of the transient growth of two- and three-dimensional optimal perturbations, and compares the predictions to other related cases examined recently. The optimal perturbation modes are shown to be highly concentrated in amplitude in the vicinity of the leading-edge corners and evolve to take the local shape of a Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz shear-layer instability further downstream. However, the dominant mode reaches a maximum amplitude downstream of the position of the reattachment point of the shear layer. The maximum energy growth increases at 2.5 decades for each increment in Reynolds number of 100. Maximum energy growth of the optimal perturbation mode at a Reynolds number of 350 is greater than , which is typically an upper limit of the Reynolds number range over which it is possible to observe steady flow experimentally. While transient growth analysis concentrates on the evolution of wavepackets rather than continuous forcing, this appears consistent with longitudinal turbulence levels of up to 1 \% for some water tunnels, and the fact that the optimal mode is highly concentrated close to the leading-edge corner so that an instantaneous projection of a perturbation field from a noisy inflow onto the optimal mode can be significant. Indeed, direct simulations with inflow noise reveal that a root-mean-square noise level of just 0.1 \% is sufficient to trigger some unsteadiness at , while a 0.5 \% level results in sustained shedding. Three-dimensional optimal perturbation mode analysis was also performed showing that at , the optimal mode has a spanwise wavelength of 11.7 plate thicknesses and is amplified 20 \% more than the two-dimensional optimal disturbance. The evolved three-dimensional mode shows strong streamwise vortical structures aligned at a shallow angle to the plate top surface.},

The nature and sequence of instabilities are compared and contrasted, especially with reference to the base case of the circular cylinder wake. The latter has been the subject of intense interest and scrutiny for well over a century, and has implicitly assumed the role of providing the generic transition scenario for turbulent wake flow. For elongated cylinders with streamlined leading edges, the analogues of the instability modes for a circular cylinder become unstable in the reverse order, which may have implications for the route to wake turbulence for such bodies. As well, the analogue of mode B has a significantly increased relative spanwise wavelength and appears to have a different near-wake structure. At the other extreme, for a normal flat plate, the wake first becomes unstable to a nonperiodic mode that appears distinct from either of the dominant circular cylinder wake modes. For tori, which have a local geometry approaching a two-dimensional circular cylinder for high aspect ratios (ARs), the sequence of transitions with increasing Reynolds number is a strong function of AR. For intermediate ARs, the first occurring wake instability mode is a subharmonic mode. Possible underlying physical mechanisms leading to some of these instabilities are also examined. In particular, support is provided for the role of idealized physical instability mechanisms in controlling wavelength selection and amplification for the dominant wake instability modes. The results presented in this article focus on relevant research undertaken by the Monash group but draws in results from many other international groups.},

  abstract = {While the wake of a circular cylinder and, to a lesser extent, the normal flat plate have been studied in considerable detail, the wakes of elliptic cylinders have not received similar attention. However, the wakes from the first two bodies have considerably different characteristics, in terms of three-dimensional transition modes, and near- and far-wake structure. This paper focuses on elliptic cylinders, which span these two disparate cases. The Strouhal number and drag coefficient variations with Reynolds number are documented for the two-dimensional shedding regime. There are considerable differences from the standard circular cylinder curve. The different three-dimensional transition modes are also examined using Floquet stability analysis based on computed two-dimensional periodic base flows. As the cylinder aspect ratio (major to minor axis) is decreased, mode~A is no longer unstable for aspect ratios below 0.25, as the wake deviates further from the standard B\'enard\textendash von K\'arm\'an~state. For still smaller aspect ratios, another three-dimensional quasi-periodic mode becomes unstable, leading to a different transition scenario. Interestingly, for the 0.25 aspect ratio case, mode~A restabilises above a Reynolds number of approximately 125, allowing the wake to return to a two-dimensional state, at least in the near wake. For the flat plate, three-dimensional simulations show that the shift in the Strouhal number from the two-dimensional value is gradual with Reynolds number, unlike the situation for the circular cylinder wake once mode~A shedding develops. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to characterise the spatially evolving character of the wake as it undergoes transition from the primary B\'enard\textendash von K\'arm\'an-like near wake into a two-layered wake, through to a secondary B\'enard\textendash von K\'arm\'an-like wake further downstream, which in turn develops an even longer wavelength unsteadiness. It is also used to examine the differences in the two- and three-dimensional near-wake state, showing the increasing distortion of the two-dimensional rollers as the Reynolds number is increased.},

Detailed Floquet analysis of the transition shows clear evidence of the growth of an elliptic instability in the forming vortex cores followed by amplification by the strong strain field in the hyperbolic region between the forming and shed vortices. In fact, it appears that the wake immediately behind the cylinder shows distinct signs of a cooperative elliptic instability as found previously for interacting counter-rotating vortices. Further downstream, after the vortices have been shed into the wake, the instability again grows in the cores. Three-dimensional simulations provide a semi-quantitative estimate of the ``elliptic content'' of instability, and confirm that elliptic instability seems to be dominant in the initiation and maintenance of the 3-D perturbation.},

  abstract = {Motivated by studies of the cylinder wake, in which the vortex-shedding frequency can be obtained from the mean flow, we study thermosolutal convection driven by opposing thermal and solutal gradients. In the archetypal two-dimensional geometry with horizontally periodic and vertical no-slip boundary conditions, branches of traveling waves and standing waves are created simultaneously by a Hopf bifurcation. Consistent with similar analyses performed on the cylinder wake, we find that the traveling waves of thermosolutal convection have the RZIF property, meaning that linearization about the mean fields of the traveling waves yields an eigenvalue whose real part is almost zero and whose imaginary part corresponds very closely to the nonlinear frequency. In marked contrast, linearization about the mean field of the standing waves yields neither zero growth nor the nonlinear frequency. It is shown that this difference can be attributed to the fact that the temporal power spectrum for the traveling waves is peaked, while that of the standing waves is broad. We give a general demonstration that the frequency of any quasimonochromatic oscillation can be predicted from its temporal mean.},

  abstract = {In this paper the flow behind a pair of bluff bodies placed side by side in a stream is studied using a variety of flow-visualization methods. Above a critical gap size between the bodies, vortex-shedding synchronization occurs, either in phase or in antiphase. It has previously been assumed that such synchronization forms a wake comprising two parallel vortex streets in phase and in antiphase respectively. In the present paper we find that two antiphase streets are indeed formed, although in-phase shedding leads to the development of a single large-scale wake. The vortices which are formed simultaneously at the cylinders rotate around one another downstream, each pair forming a `binary vortex'. The combined wake comprises a street of such vortices, which we term a binary vortex street. Below a critical gap size between the bluff bodies the flow becomes asymmetric. We observe in this regime certain harmonic modes of vortex shedding whereby the shedding frequency on one side of the wake is a multiple of that on the other. Again, a large-scale wake is formed downstream. The present observations lead to a new interpretation of hot-wire-frequency data from other studies in terms of the harmonic modes.},

  abstract = {It is now well-known that the wake transition regime for a circular cylinder involves two modes of small-scale three-dimensional instability (modes A and B), depending on the regime of Reynolds number (Re), although almost no understanding of the physical origins of these instabilities, or indeed their effects on near-wake formation, have hitherto been made clear. We address these questions in this paper. In particular, it is found that the two different modes A and B scale on different physical features of the flow. Mode A has a larger spanwise wavelength of around 3\textendash 4 diameters, and scales on the larger physical structure in the flow, namely the primary vortex core. The wavelength for mode A is shown to be the result of an `elliptic instability' in the nearwake vortex cores. The subsequent nonlinear growth of vortex loops is due to a feedback from one vortex to the next, involving spanwise-periodic deformation of core vorticity, which is then subject to streamwise stretching in the braid regios. This mode gives an out-of-phase streamwise vortex pattern.In contrast, mode-B instability has a distinctly smaller wavelength (1 diameter) which scales on the smaller physical structure in the flow, the braid shear layer. It is a manifestation of an instability in a region of hyperbolic flow. It is quite distinct from other shear flows, in that it depends on the reverse flow of the bluff-body wake; the presence of a fully formed streamwise vortex system, brought upstream from a previous half-cycle, in proximity to the newly evolving braid shear layer, leads to an in-phase stream-wise vortex array, in strong analogy with the `Mode 1' of Meiburg \& Lasheras (1988) for a forced unseparated wake. In mode B, we also observe amalgamation of streamwise vortices from a previous braid with like-sign vortices in the subsequent braid.It is deduced that the large scatter in previous measurements concerning mode A is due to the presence of vortex dislocations. Dislocations are triggered at the sites of some vortex loops of mode A, and represent a natural breakdown of the periodicity of mode A instability. By minimizing or avoiding the dislocations which occur from end contamination or which occur during wake transition, we find an excellent agreement of both critical Re and spanwise wavelength of mode A with the recent secondary stability analysis of Barkley \& Henderson (1996).Wake transition is further characterized by velocity and pressure measurements. It is consistent that, when mode-A instability and large-scale dislocations appear, one finds a reduction of base suction, a reduction of (two-dimensional) Reynolds stress level, a growth in size of the formation region, and a corresponding drop in Strouhal frequency. Finally, the present work leads us to a new clarification of the possible flow states through transition. Right through this regime of Re, there exist two distinct and continuous Strouhal frequency curves: the upper one corresponds with purley small- scale instabilities (e.g. denoted as mode A), while the lower curve corresponds with a combination of small-scale plus dislocation structures (e.g. mode A*). However, some of the flow states are transient or `unstable', and the natural transitioning wake appears to follow the scenario: (2D\textrightarrow A*\textrightarrow B).},

We bring together new concepts and phenomena generic to vortex-induced vibration (VIV) systems, and pay special attention to the vortex dynamics and energy transfer that give rise to modes of vibration, the importance of mass and damping, the concept of a critical mass, the relationship between force and vorticity, and the concept of ``effective elasticity'', among other points. We present new vortex wake modes, generally in the framework of a map of vortex modes compiled from forced vibration studies, some of which cause free vibration. Some discussion focuses on topics of current debate, such as the decomposition of force, the relevance of the paradigm flow of an elastically mounted cylinder to more complex systems, and the relationship between forced or free vibration.},

  abstract = {A parametric study has been carried out to elucidate the characteristics of flow past a square cylinder inclined with respect to the main flow in the laminar flow regime. Reynolds number and angle of incidence are the key parameters which determine the flow characteristics. Location of separation point is greatly affected by angle of incidence, thus determining the flow field around the square cylinder. The critical Reynolds number for periodic vortex shedding at each angle of incidence considered is obtained by using Stuart\textendash Landau equation. Attempt is made to classify the related flow patterns from a topological point of view, resulting in three distinct patterns in total. A comprehensive analysis of the effects of Reynolds number and angle of incidence on flow-induced forces on the square cylinder is presented. Collecting all the results obtained, contour diagrams of force and moment coefficients, Strouhal number, rms of lift-coefficient fluctuation, as well as a flow-pattern diagram are proposed for the ranges of the two parameters considered in the current investigation. Finally, a Floquet stability analysis is presented to detect the onset of the secondary instability leading to three-dimensional flow. The proposed diagrams and the Floquet stability analysis shed light on better physical understanding of the flow past a square cylinder, which should be useful in many engineering applications.}

Three categories of flow interference are proposed: proximity, wake and the combination of both. The oscillations caused by jet-switch, gap-flow-switch, wake-displacement and wake-galloping are discussed. These interference-induced oscillations are related to the reduced velocity, mass and structural damping (combined in a Scruton number) and to the number of degrees of freedom of the two cylinders. The reliable mathematical modelling is developed only for the wake galloping. Most means for suppressing vortex shedding are ineffective for the flow interference excitations.},

Numerical simulation was performed to comparably study the effect of cylinder geometry and spacing on the aerodynamic characteristics, unsteady flow patterns, time-averaged flow characteristics and flow unsteadiness. We also provided the first global linear stability analysis and sensitivity analysis on the physical problem for the potential application of flow control. The objective of this work is to quantitatively identify the effect of the cylinder geometry and spacing on the characteristic quantities. Numerical results reveal that there is wake flow transition for both geometries depending on the spacing. The characteristic quantities, including the time-averaged and fluctuating streamwise velocity and pressure coefficient, are quite similar to that of the single cylinder case for the upstream cylinder, while an entirely different variation pattern is observed for the downstream cylinder. The global linear stability analysis shows that the spatial structure of perturbation is mainly observed in the wake of the downstream cylinder for small spacing, while moves upstream with reduced size and is also observed after the upstream cylinder for large spacing. The sensitivity analysis reflects that the temporal growth rate of perturbation is the most sensitive to the near-wake flow of downstream cylinder for small spacing and upstream cylinder for large spacing.},
