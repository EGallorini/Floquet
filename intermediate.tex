We now move to the horizontal $n=1$ branch dominates by the LE vortex shedding (see figure \ref{}), i.e. to $3 \le \AR \le 4.75$, and use $\AR=4$ and $\AR=4.5$ as representative cases.

\subsection{A $2D$ bifurcation}

\subsubsection{Non linear simulations}

 The non linear simulations show that as $Re$ increases ($Re = Re_{c2}$) the 2D periodic base flow becomes unstable to two-dimensional perturbations and undergoes a synchronous bifurcation which leads to a flow having the same periodicity, but with a slanted wake. This is visualised in figure \ref{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5} that show the vorticity field of instantaneous snapshots at different $Re$. For $Re< Re_{c2}$ (left panels) the wake is aligned with the $x$ axis, and characterised by the usual alternating shedding of vortices with positive/negative vorticity along the $y=0$ line. This flow regime is detailed in \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}, and here it is only briefly characterised for completeness. At these parameters flow dynamics is dominated by the LE vortex shedding, and a single vortex is placed at each time over the lateral sides of the cylinder. The LE vortices are advected downstream and, when they cross the TE, an hyperbolic stagnation point arises and a new TE vortex with vorticity of opposite sign is shed from the opposite side \citep{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}. Here the passage of the LE vortex over the TE corner is in phase with the generation of a new TE vortex from the oppsite side of the cylinder. The relative phase at which positive (negative) LE vortices cross the TE and negative (positive) TE vortices are shed in the wake changes slightly changes with $\AR$, explaining the differences in the wake between the $\AR=4$ and the $\AR=4.5$ cases. For $\AR=4$ the LE vortices in the wake are weaker. When the Reynolds number is increased beyond $Re_{c2}$ and the flow bifurcates, the flow looses its (average) symmetry with respect to an inversion of the $y$ axis and exhibits a slanted wake. In this case, indeed, the vortex monopoled are not placed along the $y=0$ line, but they deviate apart. For $\AR=4$ this is observed for $Re \gtrapprox 435$, while for $\AR=4.5$ for $Re \gtrapprox 417.5$. Clearly, the top/bottom direction of the slanted wake changes with the initial conditions and depends on the spatial structure of the initial perturbation.

Figure \ref{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4} illustrated the dependence of the aerodynamic forces $C_\ell$ and $C_d$ and of the flow period $T$ on $Re$. Note that for $Re>Re_{c2}$ the unstable straight wake is stabilised by means of the BoostConv algorithm, As expected by the flow symmetries, $C_\ell=0$ for $Re \le Re_{c2}$ and $C_\ell \neq 0$ for $Re > Re_{c2}$. On the other sides, the aerodynamic drag $C_d$ increases with $Re$ in both regimes, but it increases faster in the slanted configuration. Figure \ref{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4}(c) shows that this bifurcation is og synchronous nature, as the value of $T$ collapse to the same line for both configurations showing a monotonous decrease as $Re$ increases.

\end{figure}

To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we have studied the linear stability of the straight wake to 2D ($\beta=0$) perturbations, using Floquet theory. We have looked at both $\AR=4$ and $\AR=4.5$, but for brevity we report only the results for the latter aspect ratio. Figure \ref{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0}(a-b) shows with straight lines the multipliers associated with the straight wake. The red colour refers to synchronous perturbations, i.e. real and positive multipliers. The blue colour, instead, refers to complex conjugate multipliers i.e. to quasi-periodic modes. The red branch crosses the unit circle at $Re = Re_{c2} \approx 417.5$ (for $\AR=4$ we measure $Re_{c2} \approx 425$). The fact that $\Im(\mu)=0$ confirms that the slatend wake is the result of a synchronous global instability of the wake. The blue branch associated with the quasi-periodic mode does not become unstable in the considered range of parameters. 

To provide further details, figure \ref{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0} shows the spanwise vorticity of the unstable Floquet mode together with isolines of the base-flow vorticity. In the wake, the unstable mode generates dipoles of spanwise vorticity that frow in space and time as they are advected downstream. A synchronisation between the base flow and the perturbation field is obseved, with the dipoles of the linear mode being centred with the base-flow vortices at all times. A dipolar perturbation of a monopolar vortex is often referred to as displacement mode \citep{brion-sipp-jacquin-2014} and is known to result in a displacement of the vorticity centroid similarly to what observed for $Re>Re_{c2}$ in figure \ref{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5}. We consider a positive base-flow virticity monopole in the wake. Here the Floquet dipole has positive vorticity in the lower part and negative vorticity in the upper part. This superposition stregthens the lower part of the monopole and weaken the top part, resulting into a net displacement  of the monopole in the downwards direction. In the monopoles of negative base-flow vorticity, instead, the scenario is the opposite. The Floquet dipole has positive vorticity in the top part of the monopole and negative vorticity in the bottom part. This strengthens the bottom part of the monopole and weakens the top parti, resulting again into a downward shift of the monopole. This explains the vertical displacement of the vortex centroids shown in figures \ref{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5}. We mention that this mechanism resembles that observed in \cite{jallas-marquet-fabre-2017} in the case of pitching airfoils.

For completeness, we report that the slanted wake is then unstable to 2D perturbations of quasi-periodic nature. However, as shown in the following this is a secondary bifurcation of the slanted-wake base flow, as the flow becomes three-dimensional at lower $Re$.

We now characterise the influence of the non linearity on the growth of the 2D mode..

\subsection{The 3D bifurcation}


%
Notably, this new slanted wake is strongly unstable to three-dimensional perturbations of subharmonic nature, being characterised by a small spanwise wavelenght (a large value of $\beta$); see figure \ref{fig:2Dmultipliers}. The linear stability of the slanted wake to three-dimensional perturbations has been investigated again by mean of Floquet analysis. For $Re \ge 435$ we have found a Floquet multiplier outside the unit circle, having negative imaginary part. For $Re=450$ we found $ mu \approx (-4.8,0)$ for $\beta=7$ ({\color{red} we still have to study the dependence of the results on the vertical extent of the computational domain}). The 
structure of the mode is shown in the bottom panel of figure \ref{fig:AR4_Floquet_modes}. This is clearly an unstable mode of the wake. The mode, indeed, in almost null over the lateral sides of the cylinder where instead the flow dynamics is driven by the vortices shed by the LE.

  \label{fig:nl_AR4_Re427}
\end{figure}

We start considering $\AR=4$, which is in the first horizontal branch of the $St-\AR$ curve. We observe that the flow regime changes as $Re$ increases. For $Re \le 425$ the flow is periodic and the wake is straight. For larger $Re$, instead, the wake experiences an additional bifurcation and becomes slanted. For this $\AR$, the flow experiences a secondary two-dimensional bifurcation towards a limit cycle with the same frequency, before becoming three-dimensional. This is visualised in figures \ref{fig:vort_AR4_Re425} and \ref{fig:vort_AR4_Re450} where flow snapshots are shown for $Re=425$ and $Re=450$. For the lowest $Re$ the wake is straight and characterised by the usual alternating shedding of vortices with positive/negative vorticity from the bottom/top sides of the cylinder. Note that vortices are shed also from the LE, and in agreement with previous results in literature, a single vortex is place at each time over the lateral sides. At $Re=450$, instead, we find a slanted wake. In this case, indeed, the vortex monopoles are not placed along the $y=0$ line, but progressively deviate a part. This has been observed for $Re \ge 435$. 

To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we have studied the linear stability of the straight wake to two-dimensional perturbations, using Floquet theory; see figure \ref{fig:2Dmultipliers}. For $Re=425$ we have found a multiplier that is very lose to the unit circle being $\mu \approx (0.97,0)$. This agrees with the fact that at this $Re$ the straight wake is stable and that it becomes unstable at slightly larger $Re$. Also, the fact that $\Im(\mu)= 0$ confirms the fact that the slanted wake is the result of a synchronous global instability of the wake. To provide further details, in the top panel of figure \ref{fig:AR4_Floquet_modes} we show the structure of the Floquet mode with isolines of the base-flow vorticity. In the wake the unstable mode generates dipoles of spanwise vorticity that grow in space and time as they are advected downstream. A synchronisation between the base flow and the perturbation field is observed, with the dipoles of the linear mode being centred with the the base-flow vortices at all times. %
A dipolar perturbation of a monopolar vortex is often referred to as displacement mode \citep{brion-sipp-jacquin-2014} and is known to result in a displacement of the vorticity centroid, similarly to what observed in figure \ref{fig:vort_AR4_Re450}. We consider the first positive base-flow vorticity monopole in the wake. Here the Floquet dipole has positive vorticity in the upper part, and negative vorticity in the lower part. This superposition strengthens the top part of the monopole and weakens the bottom part, resulting into a net displacement of the monopole in the upward direction. In contrast, in the second monopole of negative base-flow vorticity the scenario is the opposite. The Floquet dipole has positive vorticity in the bottom part of the monopole, and negative vorticity in the top part %. This strengthens the top part of the monopole and weaken the bottom part, and result
resulting again into a upward shift of the monopole. This explains the vertical displacement of the vortex centroids shown in figure \ref{fig:vort_AR4_Re450}. Overall, this mechanism resembles what observed in \cite{jallas-marquet-fabre-2017} in the case of pitching airfoils.

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is still not clear whether the slanted wake is stable for a certain range of $Re$. It actually seems that when the wake becomes slanted it is immediately unstable to three-dimensional perturbations. How is it possible?
  \item After characterising the linear stability of the straight- and slanted-wake configuration it would be interesting to investigate the influence of the non linearity. We can follow the same approach proposed by \cite{jallas-marquet-fabre-2017}. We can stabilise the bifurcation, and write the non linear perturbation at a certain $Re$ as $\{ \bm{u}'',p'' \} = \{\bm{u},p \} - \{\bm{u}_S,p_S \}$, where we use the $\cdot_S$ subscript when referring to the symmetric configuration. At this point we have can plot the perturbation and discuss it. Also, we may also divide it is the symmetric and anisymmetric part to then address what is the influence of the two symmetric and asymmetric modes. Before doing this, we need to use BoostConv to symmetrise the flow, and compute the forces, to understand which is the question we want to address.
  \item Is the mechanism associated with the instability a viscous one? A possible approach would be to perform the Floquet stability by progressively increasing the $Re$?
  \item Also, why the flow becomes suddenly unstable to 3D perturbations once the wake becomes slanted? That mode is not present in the spectrum of the straight wake. My idea is that the feedback that leads to this mode is associated with something close to the trailing edge that appears only in this case. What about looking again at the close orbits, like Giannetti (2010)? We have already tried in a different set up, and we already have the code for this kind of computations.
  \item The scenario seems to hold also for $\AR=4.5$; see figure \ref{fig:vort_AR4p5_Re450}. Actually, in this case flow the low-$Re$ straight wake we observe two multipliers that approach the unit circle for $\beta=0$. One is real and positive (as for $\AR=4$), while one is complex. However, the structure of the mode is similar in both cases (see figure \ref{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0}. For $Re=430$ they are $\mu = (1.249,0)$ and $\mu=(0.7949, \pm 0.52)$. Also, once the wake settles to the slanted configuration, similarly to what observed for $\AR=4$ we observe that it is strongly unstable to 3D perturbations with a small spanwise wavelength. Overall, this has been confirmed by Direct numerical simulations; see figure \ref{fig:lambda2_omegax_AR45_Re450}.

%\caption{DNS of the flow past the rectangular cylinder with $\AR=4.5$ at $Re=450$. Red/blue isosurfaces indicate $%\omega_x = \pm 0.015$. Note that the wake is slanted and three-dimensional, as predicted by the Floquet stabilty analysis. The spanwise extent of the computational domain is $L_z=2\pi$.This means that the wavenumber associated with the three-dimensionality is $\beta \approx 6$, which is consistent with the most amplified wavenumber detected with the stability analysis.}
