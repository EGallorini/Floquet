\section{Intermediate $\AR$s with $3 < \AR < 4.75$}

We now turn to the horizontal $n=1$ branch, which is dominated by leading-edge (LE) vortex shedding (see figure~\ref{}), corresponding to the range $ 3 \le \AR \le 4.75$. Within this regime, we use $\AR=4$ and $\AR=4.5$ as representative cases.

  \label{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5}
\end{figure}

Nonlinear simulations show that as the Reynolds number increases and reaches $Re = Re_{c2}$, the two-dimensional periodic base flow becomes unstable to two-dimensional perturbations and undergoes a synchronous bifurcation. The resulting flow retains the same temporal periodicity but develops a slanted wake. This transition is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5}, which presents instantaneous vorticity fields at various Reynolds numbers.
%
For $Re \le Re_{c2}$ (left panels), the wake remains aligned with the $x$-axis and exhibits the classical von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n-type shedding: alternating vortices of opposite sign are released along the centreline $y=0$. This regime, extensively discussed in \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}, is briefly summarised here for completeness. At these parameters, the dynamics are dominated by LE vortex shedding, with a single vortex forming alternately on each side of the cylinder. These LE vortices are advected downstream and, upon passing the TE, generate a hyperbolic stagnation point that initiates the shedding of a new TE vortex of opposite sign from the opposite side of the body \citep{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}.
%
Importantly, the passage of the LE vortex over the TE corner occurs in phase with the shedding of the corresponding TE vortex. The relative phase between LE passage and TE shedding varies slightly with aspect ratio $\AR$, accounting for differences in the wake structure between the $\AR=4$ and $\AR=4.5$ cases. In particular, for $\AR=4$, the LE vortices appearing in the wake are notably weaker.
%
Beyond the critical Reynolds number $Re_{c2}$, the flow bifurcates and loses its average symmetry with respect to reflection across the $y=0$ axis, resulting in a slanted wake. In this regime, the vortex monopoles are no longer aligned along $y=0$, but deviate above or below the centreline. For $\AR=4$, this transition occurs at $Re \ge Re_{c2} \approx 435$, and for $\AR=4.5$, at $Re \ge Re_{c2} \approx 417.5$. The orientation (upward or downward) of the slanted wake is determined by the initial conditions and reflects the structure of the imposed perturbation.

  \label{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4}
\end{figure}
%
Figure \ref{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4} illustrates the dependence of the aerodynamic force coefficients $C_\ell$ and $C_d$, as well as the flow period $T$, on the Reynolds number $Re$ for $\AR=4$. For $Re>Re_{c2}$, the unstable straight-wake solution is stabilised using the BoostConv algorithm. As dictated by flow symmetry, the lift coefficient satisfies $C_\ell=0$ for $Re \le Re_{c2}$, whereas $C_\ell \neq 0$ for $Re> Re_{c2}$, reflecting the loss of symmetry associated with the bifurcation. In contrast, the drag coefficient $C_d$ increases with $Re$ across both regimes, but the rate of increase is higher in the slanted-wake configuration.
%
Figure \ref{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4}(c) further confirms the synchronous nature of the bifurcation: the flow period $T$ collapses onto a single curve for both configurations, decreasing monotonically with increasing $Re$. The smooth transitions observed in the $C_\ell-Re$ and $C_d-Re$ curves suggest that the bifurcation is supercritical. This point will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

\label{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0}
\end{figure}

To investigate the origin of the slanted-wake phenomenon, we perform a linear stability analysis of the straight wake with respect to two-dimensional ($\beta=0$) perturbations using Floquet theory. Both aspect ratios $\AR=4$ and $\AR=4.5$ are considered, but for brevity, we report results only for the latter. Figure \ref{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0}(a--b) presents the Floquet multipliers associated with the straight-wake solution. Synchronous perturbations---i.e. those with real, positive multipliers---are shown in red, while complex-conjugate multipliers corresponding to quasi-periodic modes are shown in blue.

The red branch crosses the unit circle at $Re=Re_{c2} \approx 417.5$; for $\AR=4$, a similar crossing is observed at $Re_{c2} \approx 425$. The fact that $\Im(\mu) = 0$ at onset confirms that the bifurcation is synchronous in nature, and that the slanted wake arises from a global instability of the straight-wake base flow. The blue branch associated with the quasi-periodic mode remains stable over the parameter range considered.

Further insight is provided in figure~\ref{fig:AR4p5_modes_Re430_beta0}(c), which shows the spanwise vorticity field of the unstable Floquet mode superimposed on isolines of the base-flow vorticity. The unstable mode does not obey the same spatio-temporal symmetry of the periodic base-flow. According to the time-average symmetry breaking, indeed, this mode satisfies
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{u}(x,y,t) = - \hat{u}(x,-y,t+T/2) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \hat{v}(x,y,t) = \hat{v}(x,-y,t+T/2)
\end{equation}
%
which leads to
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\omega}_z(x,y,t) = \hat{\omega}_z(x,-y,t+T/2).
\end{equation}
%
In the wake region, the mode generates dipolar perturbations that grow as they are advected downstream. A clear synchronisation is observed between the base flow and the perturbation field: the dipolar structures of the Floquet mode remain phase-locked with the base-flow vortices at all times.

Such a dipolar perturbation of a monopolar base-flow vortex is often referred to as a displacement mode \citep{brion-sipp-jacquin-2014}, as it effectively shifts the centroid of vorticity. This mechanism is consistent with the displacement of vortex cores observed for $Re>Re_{c2}$ in figure~\ref{fig:snap_ar4_ar4p5}. Considering a positive base-flow vortex in the wake, the associated Floquet dipole exhibits positive vorticity in its lower part and negative vorticity in the upper part. The superposition of the two fields therefore strengthens the lower half of the monopole and weakens the upper half, resulting in a net downward displacement. For negative base-flow vortices, the opposite dipole orientation yields a similar downward shift. This coherent mechanism accounts for the systematic vertical displacement of the vortex centroids in the slanted-wake configuration.
%
We note that this mechanism closely resembles that described by \citet{jallas-marquet-fabre-2017} in the context of pitching airfoils.

Finally, for completeness, we mention that the slanted-wake solution is itself unstable to two-dimensional quasi-periodic perturbations. However, as shown in the following, this constitutes a secondary bifurcation of the slanted-wake base flow. In contrast, the transition to three-dimensionality occurs at lower Reynolds numbers and thus represents the primary route to complexity in this regime.

  \label{fig:ar4p5_nnl}
\end{figure}

The linear stability analysis presented in the previous section captures the onset of the instability but does not provide a description of the resulting asymmetric limit cycle. While linear theory is sufficient to determine the critical Reynolds number $Re_{c2}$, understanding the flow dynamics beyond the onset requires incorporating nonlinear effects.

Near a critical point, the wake dynamics can be approximated by a reduced-order discrete-time dynamical system, as proposed by \cite{henderson-barkley-1996} and \cite{henderson-1997}. To this end, we represent the full velocity field as
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{u}(\bm{x}, t) = U \bm{u}_0(\bm{x}, t) + A(t) \bm{u}_1(\bm{x}, t),
\end{equation}
%
where $||\bm{u}_0||=1$ and $||\bm{u}_1||=1$, $\bm{u}_0$ denotes the base flow, and $\bm{u}_1$ is the leading unstable Floquet mode with time-dependent amplitude $A(t)$. To reduce the problem to a discrete map, we sample the system at discrete times $t_n = t_0 + nT$, corresponding to successive vortex-shedding periods. The flow field at each time step becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{u}(\bm{x}, t_n) = U \bm{u}_0(\bm{x}, t_n) + A_n \bm{u}_1(\bm{x}, t_n),
\end{equation}
%
where $A_n \equiv A(t_n)$. Thus, the evolution of the flow is governed by the discrete-time dynamics of the amplitude $A_n$, while the evolution of $\bm{u}_1$ characterises the nonlinear distortion of the perturbation.

To classify the nature of the secondary instability, we adopt the normal form for a pitchfork bifurcation in a discrete-time dynamical system:
%
\begin{equation}
A_{n+1} = \left( \mu + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \alpha_j A_n^{2j} \right) A_n,
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha_1$ is the Landau constant, and $\mu$ characterises the linear growth rate. The sign of $\alpha_1$ determines the nature of the bifurcation: if $\alpha_1<0$, the bifurcation is supercritical (soft); if $\alpha_1>0$, it is subcritical (hard) \citep{kuznetsov-1997}. In the supercritical case, the amplitude of the resulting nonlinear state can be approximated by retaining only the first two terms of the expansion. Introducing the reduced control parameter $\epsilon = (Re-Re_{c2})/Re_{c2}$, and writing $\mu = 1 + \mu' \epsilon$ (where $\mu'  = \partial \mu/\partial Re$), the equilibrium amplitude is given by
%
\begin{equation}
|A|^2 = - \frac{\mu' \epsilon}{\alpha_1}.
\end{equation}
%
It is worth emphasising that, owing to the two-dimensional and synchronous nature of the bifurcation, it is not possible to clearly separate the nonlinear evolution of the unstable mode from the distortion of the base flow. In contrast, such a separation would be feasible in the context of a weakly nonlinear stability analysis about the periodic limit cycle, where perturbations can be decomposed into distinct components associated with the leading mode and its higher-order interactions. In the present case, the bifurcating flow is time-periodic, and the instability develops synchronously with the base-cycle frequency. As a result, the nonlinear perturbation and the base flow evolve concurrently and interact nonlinearly in a coupled manner, preventing a clean modal decomposition. A formal weakly nonlinear analysis of the limit cycle, which could in principle isolate the contribution of the unstable Floquet mode and systematically capture its nonlinear saturation, lies beyond the scope of the present study.

To determine the nonlinear character of the secondary instability, we perform direct numerical simulations at $Re\approx Re_{c2}$, tracking the evolution of the perturbation field written as $\bm{u}_1 + \bm{u}_{nl}$, where $\bm{u}_{nl}$ represents the nonlinear correction. Simulations are initialised with $\bm{u}_{nl}(t_0) = \bm{u}^1(t_0)$, and the amplitude at each period is computed as
%
\begin{equation}
|A_n|^2 = \frac{1}{\Omega U_\infty^2} \int_\Omega |\bm{u}_{nl}(\bm{x},t_n)|^2 \mathrm{d} \Omega.
\end{equation}
%
The nonlinear coefficients $\alpha_j$ are then estimated from the evolution of $A_n$ over time.

Figure~\ref{fig:ar4p5_nnl} reports results for $\AR=4.5$ at $Re=420$ (corresponding to $\epsilon \approx 0.01$). Similar results are obtained for $\AR=4$. Starting from a small initial perturbation, the instability grows and saturates after approximately $\mathcal{O}(50)$ shedding periods. At this Reynolds number, the linear growth rate is $\mu = 1.083$. However, as the amplitude approaches saturation, the growth of $A_n$ slows and deviates from the exponential trend predicted by linear theory. Fitting the amplitude evolution yields a Landau coefficient $\alpha_1 \approx - 0.011<0$, indicating that the bifurcation is supercritical. This conclusion is consistent with the smooth transition observed in the $C_\ell-Re$ and $C_d-Re$ diagrams shown in figure~\ref{fig:Cl-Cd-AR4}.

  \label{fig:pert-nl}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:pert-nl} presents instantaneous snapshots of both the linear and nonlinear perturbation fields. As discussed previously, the linear perturbation is characterised by an array of dipolar structures aligned with the streamwise direction and centred on the monopolar vortices of the base flow. Immediately downstream of the TE, the nonlinear perturbation closely resembles the linear one, indicating that nonlinear effects remain negligible in the near wake.
%
However, as the flow progresses downstream, nonlinear interactions become increasingly significant. The structure of the nonlinear perturbation diverges from its linear counterpart, exhibiting a spatial reorganisation in the cross-stream direction. In particular, the dipolar vortices of the nonlinear perturbation are no longer centred on the base-flow monopoles. Instead, they spread laterally and arrange themselves such that the perturbation field locally counteracts the vorticity of the base flow. This leads to a partial cancellation of the base-flow vortices, effectively erasing the symmetry of the straight-wake configuration in the fully developed nonlinear flow.

  \label{fig:mul-3d-ar4p5}
\end{figure}

For $Re \ge Re_{c2}$, the flow evolves toward a new limit cycle characterised by a deflected (or slanted) wake, as discussed in the previous section. This two-dimensional state is found to be strongly unstable to three-dimensional perturbations. We investigate the linear stability of this deflected wake using Floquet analysis, focusing on the case $\AR=4.5$; qualitatively similar results are obtained for $\AR=4$.

Figure~\ref{fig:mul-3d-ar4p5} displays the leading Floquet multipliers as functions of Reynolds number in the range $Re_{c2} \approx 417.5 \le Re \le 450$, and for spanwise wavenumbers $3.5 \le \beta \le 10$. The first three-dimensional instability appears at $Re = Re_{c3} \approx 420$, associated with a spanwise wavenumber of $\beta \approx 7$, indicating that the deflected two-dimensional wake remains stable over only a very narrow range beyond the bifurcation at $Re_{c2}$. For $Re > Re_{c3}$, a continuous band of unstable wavenumbers emerges, with the upper bound $\beta_{\max}$ showing only a weak dependence on $Re$. Notably, the growth rate of the instability increases rapidly with Reynolds number, with the dominant multiplier reaching $|\mu| \approx 2$ at $Re=425$ and $|\mu| \approx 9$ at $Re=450$.

The unstable Floquet multipliers are real and negative, confirming that the deflected wake is unstable to three-dimensional perturbations of subharmonic character. As shown by \cite{marques-lopez-blackburn-2004} and \cite{blackburn-etal-2005}, such subharmonic Floquet multipliers---real and negative with zero imaginary part---cannot occur in flows that retain spatio-temporal symmetry, as is the case at lower Reynolds numbers. However, once the base flow symmetry is broken, as in the present case, subharmonic instabilities may arise. Similar behaviour has been observed in other configurations, such as the flow past a square cylinder at non-zero incidence angle \citep{blackburn-sheard-2010}.

Figure~\ref{fig:3dmode-ar4p5}(a) shows the spatial structure of the real part of the streamwise vorticity associated with the unstable Floquet mode at $Re=450$ and $\beta=8$. The perturbation field is concentrated near the vortex cores of the base flow, a typical feature of wake instabilities in bluff-body flows \citep[see, e.g.,][]{thompson-leweke-williamson-2001, chaurasia-thompson-2011}. Importantly, the perturbation is highly localised in the wake and exhibits negligible amplitude over the lateral sides of the cylinder. This confirms that, unlike the QS instability mode discussed in \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022d} (see also the following section), the current mode is not triggered by the LE vortices. Instead, it is an unstable mode of the wake itself. The mode’s spatial symmetry is consistent with its subharmonic nature: the sign of the streamwise vorticity alternates from one period to the next, as expected for a mode with Floquet multiplier with $\mu<0$ and $\Im(\mu) = 0$.

  \label{fig:ss3d}
\end{figure}

To further characterise the three-dimensional instability and identify the associated wavemaker region, we compute the spectral norm of the instantaneous structural sensitivity tensor $I$, following the formulation of \cite{giannetti-camarri-luchini-2010}. This quantity is defined as
\begin{equation}
I(x, y, \beta, t) = \frac{ \hat{\bm{u}}^\dagger(x, y, \beta, t), \hat{\bm{u}}(x, y, \beta, t) }{ \int_t^{t+T} \int_{\Omega} \hat{\bm{u}}^\dagger \cdot \hat{\bm{u}}, \mathrm{d}\Omega, \mathrm{d}t },
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\bm{u}}$ and $\hat{\bm{u}}^\dagger$ denote the direct and adjoint Floquet modes, respectively. The direct mode highlights regions of largest perturbation growth, while the adjoint mode represents the receptivity of the flow to external disturbances. Their pointwise product---the structural sensitivity $I$---thus localises the regions of strongest feedback between amplification and receptivity, identifying the so-called wavemaker region \citep{monkewitz-huerre-chomaz-1993}.

As a product of time-periodic direct and adjoint modes, the structural sensitivity inherits the periodicity of the base flow, satisfying $I(x,y,\beta,t) = I (x,y,\beta,t+T)$. The spectral norm $||I||$ is found to be negligible throughout most of the domain, except in a confined region just downstream of the TE, confirming that the instability is localised within the wake and is not driven by upstream (e.g. leading-edge) dynamics.

The maximum of $I$ remains localised near the TE vortex throughout the entire shedding cycle, indicating that the wavemaker is tightly coupled to the unsteady vortex dynamics in this region. Notably, at phase instants $t/T=0.25$ and $t/T=0.75$, the peak sensitivity coincides with the hyperbolic stagnation point formed just downstream of the TE. At $t/T=0.5$ and $t/T=1$, the sensitivity maximum shifts to the region of maximum streamline curvature within the vortex structure. This phase-dependent localisation confirms that the triggering and feedback mechanisms responsible for the instability are embedded in the dynamics of the TE vortex interaction and are modulated periodically in time.

\end{figure}

Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been carried out to extend the results of the Floquet stability analysis and to capture the influence of nonlinear effects on the flow dynamics. The Reynolds number was varied in the range $425 \le Re \le 500$, i.e. above the critical threshold $Re_{c3} \approx 420$ identified by the Floquet analysis. The simulations were initialised using the two-dimensional potential flow solution, ensuring an unambiguous evolution toward the nonlinear attractor.

The simulations confirm that at these parameters the flow develops a deflected wake and acquires a fully three-dimensional structure, as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:dns-ar4p5}. Instantaneous isocontours of the streamwise vorticity reveal a clear modulation in the spanwise direction for $ XX \le Re \le XX $, with a dominant spanwise wavenumber of approximately $\beta \approx 6$, in good agreement with the most amplified mode predicted by the linear Floquet analysis. Importantly, no appreciable three-dimensional structure is observed along the lateral sides of the cylinder, confirming that the instability is confined to the wake and not influenced by the leading-edge vortex dynamics.
