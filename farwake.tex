Note that as $Re$ increases the structure of the wake changes, with the positive and negative vorticity monopoles being clearly separated. As $Re$ increases, this separation start occurring closer to the TE. Bottom panel: Dependence of the period $T$ on $Re$ for the periodic regime in the $350 \le Re \le 485$ range.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For $\AR=3$ we observe that the wake becomes unstable in the far wake.
  \item Study Batchelor and Lamb. Look for instability of trains of vortices
  \item How can the far wake be influenced by the body? Porbaby we have this phenopmena also at different AR, and with different bodies, but it happens at conditions different from the one we observed, since the wake is already 3d, or, for example at AR=4, the wake become storta so we do not see this phenomenom.
\end{itemize}
