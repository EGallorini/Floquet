\section{Short bodies}
\label{sec:short}


We begin by examining short bodies with aspect ratios in the range $1 \le \AR <3$, to assess how a modest increase in $\AR$ alters the bifurcation structure and the sequence in which flow modes become unstable, relative to the well-studied $\AR=1$ case. This analysis complements the work of \cite{choi-yang-2014}, who investigated the onset of secondary instabilities for bodies ranging from a normal flat plate ($\AR \rightarrow 0$) to a square cylinder ($\AR=1$).

\subsection{The base flow}

We begin by characterising the influence of aspect ratio $\AR$ and Reynolds number $Re$ on the periodic base flow. Figure \ref{fig:T_Re_small} shows the variation of the base-flow shedding period $T$ with both parameters. In figure \ref{fig:T_Re_small}(b), for $\AR=1.25$, results are not reported beyond $Re=240$, as the two-dimensional base flow loses periodicity near $Re \approx 250$ due to a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation (not shown for brevity).
%
The shedding period exhibits a strong dependence on both $\AR$ and $Re$. For the shortest bodies ($\AR \lessapprox 1$), the period $T$ varies only mildly with $Re$: for example, when $Re$ increases from $140$ to $230$, $T$ increases by approximately $2.2\%$ for $\AR=0.75$, see figure \ref{fig:T_Re_small}(b). In contrast, for intermediate ($1 \lessapprox \AR \lessapprox 1.5$) and longer bodies ($\AR \gtrapprox 1.5$), the variation is more pronounced. Over the same $Re$ range, $T$ increases by $12.6\%$ for $\AR=1.25$, while it decreases by $12.9\%$ for $\AR=3$.
%
When holding $Re$ fixed and varying $\AR$, figure~\ref{fig:T_Re_small}(a) shows that $T$ increases monotonically with $\AR$ for $Re \le 140$. At higher Reynolds numbers, however, $T$ displays a non-monotonic dependence on $\AR$, with a maximum around the intermediate $\AR \approx 1.25$. Interestingly, the dependence of $T$ on both $\AR$ and $Re$ mirrors that of the time-averaged wake recirculation length $\ell_w$ (see the inset in figure \ref{fig:T_Re_small}(v)), measured using the mean streamline defined by $\aver{\Psi_b} = 0$, where the streamfunction $\Psi_b$ satisfies $\bm{\nabla}^2 \Psi_b = - \omega$.

  \label{fig:Av_Re140_Re230}
\end{figure} 

The varying trends in the shedding period $T$ with Reynolds number across aspect ratios reflect changes in the base-flow topology and in the underlying vortex shedding mechanisms. These are illustrated in figures~\ref{fig:snap_Re140_Re230} and \ref{fig:Av_Re140_Re230}, which show instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields for $Re=14$ and $Re=230$, across different $\AR$.
%
For shorter bodies ($\AR \lessapprox 1$), the flow separates at the LE corners and only rarely reattaches along the lateral sides, regardless of $Re$. In this regime, vortex shedding is primarily governed by the dynamics of the LE shear layer, which actively participates in the formation of the wake vortex. As shown in figure \ref{fig:snap_Re140_Re230}, the LE shear layer delineates the boundary of the vortex as it is shed downstream.
%
In contrast, for longer bodies ($\AR \gtrapprox 1.5$), the LE shear layer reattaches along the lateral sides across all considered $Re$, and the vortex shedding is predominantly driven by the TE shear layers. For the intermediate case ($1 \lessapprox \AR \lessapprox 1.5$), the base-flow topology varies with Reynolds number: at lower $Re$, the flow resembles that of longer bodies, with intermittent reattachment of the LE shear layer and shedding governed by the TE. At higher $Re$, however, the flow shifts toward the low-$\AR$ topology, with the LE shear layer again playing the dominant role in vortex formation.
%
This transition is reflected in the behaviour of the shedding period $T$ in figure~\ref{fig:T_Re_small}(b). When vortex shedding is LE-driven, $T$ increases with $Re$, likely due to interactions between the LE shear layer and the TE corners. Conversely, when the LE shear layer reattaches and shedding is driven by the TE, $T$ decreases with increasing $Re$. This shift in topology is consistent with the increasing separation angle at the LE corners as $Re$ rises. Furthermore, the critical Reynolds number at which this topological transition occurs increases with $\AR$, as evidenced by the turning points in the $T-Re$ curves in figure~\ref{fig:T_Re_small}(b).

To further investigate how flow dyanmics varies with aspect ratio $\AR$ and Reynolds number ReRe, we perform a global stability analysis of the mean flow, averaged over one shedding period. We focus on the leading eigenmode, which captures the dominant unsteady features of the flow. Similar approaches have been applied to the circular cylinder \citep{pier-2002, barkley-2006} and to elongated rectangular cylinders \citep{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}.
%
The frequency of the leading eigenmode provides a good estimate of the Strouhal number observed in the nonlinear simulations across all cases, see table~\ref{tab:eigs}. Unlike the marginally stable mean flow observed for the circular cylinder \citep{barkley-2006}, our analysis yields slightly negative growth rates, suggesting a weakly damped but still dynamically relevant mean flow instability.

Figure~\ref{fig:sens-short} shows the structural sensitivity of the leading eigenmode. This quantity, introduced by \cite{giannetti-luchini-2007}, provides an upper bound on the variation of the eigenvalue resulting from a localised perturbation of the linearised Navier--Stokes operator. It corresponds to a ``force–velocity'' coupling: the feedback from a localised velocity sensor to a colocated force actuator. As such, structural sensitivity serves as an indicator of the eigenvalue's sensitivity to flow modifications and identifies the so-called wavemaker region \citep{monkewitz-etal-1993}---the core region responsible for the instability.
%
The structural sensitivity field reveals that the wavemaker is generally concentrated near the body, where the overlap of the direct and adjoint modes is largest. For longer bodies and lower $Re$, non-zero sensitivity is confined to the wake downstream of the TE, especially along the streamline bounding the mean recirculation zone. This confirms that, in these cases, the instability is driven primarily by the TE shear layers.
%
In contrast, for shorter bodies and/or higher ReRe, significant sensitivity also appears along the LE shear layers over the lateral sides. This indicates that the wavemaker extends upstream, confirming that the LE shear layers actively contribute to the vortex shedding mechanism. Overall, these results are consistent with the earlier discussion on the transition in flow topology and the corresponding changes in the shedding dynamics.

  \label{fig:bf-short}
\end{figure}
%
The influence of $\AR$ on the base-flow topology is shown in figure \ref{fig:bf-short}. For the smaller $\AR < 1.25$, for all considered $Re$ the flow separates at the LE and only rarely reattaches along the lateral sides of the body. In this case the vortex shedding in the wake is thus determined by the dynamics of the LE shear which is indeed active in the formation of the wake vortex. This is visualised in the figure \ref{fig:bf-short} by the streamline separating from the LE that indeed delimits the wake vortex before it is shed in the wake. By contrast, for the larger $\AR>1.25$the LE shear layer (intermittently) reattaches along the lateral sides of the body at all $Re$, and the wake dynamics is mostly determined by the TE shear layer.
For the intermediate $\AR=1.25$ the base-flow topology changes with $Re$. At the lower $Re \le 210$ the flow resembles what has been observed for longer bodies (with the LE shear layer intermittently reattaching along the lateral sides of the body), and the wake vortex shedding is driven by the TE shear layers. At the higher Reynolds numbers ($Re>210$), instead, the flow recovers the low-$\AR$ topology, with the wake dynamics being primarily driven by the LE shear layers. This is visualised in figure \ref{}, when comparing panels xx and xx and noting that the streamline separating at the LE corner reattaches for $Re=200$, but not for $Re=250$. This change of topology is explained with the fact that an increase of $Re$ leads to an increase of the angle with which the flow separates at the LE corners.

\end{figure}
%
We look at the mean flow averaged over one shedding period; see figure \ref{fig:mf_lengths}. For all $\AR$ an increase of $Re$ leads to an increase of the angle with which the flow separates; see dependence on $Re$ of $y_s$ and $y_w$. As a result the LE shear layers become thicker as $Re$ increases, being thus responsible for the decrease of $\ell_w$. For $\AR=1.25$ the an increase of the Reynolds number leads to a fast increase of $\ell_w$ (and $x_w$) for $Re>210$, which well correlates with the increase of the shedding period. Note that, on average, the flow reattaches along the lateral sides of the body only for $\AR \ge 1.5$ and $Re \le 200$.

%
To further highlight the change of the flow topology with $\AR$ and $Re$, we perform a global stability analysis of the mean flow averaged over one shedding period. The focus in on the leading eigenmode, which is representative of the unsteady phenomena of the flow. For a similar approach see for example \cite{pier-2002,barkley-2006} for the circular cylinder and \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022} for rectangular cylinders. 

The frequency of the leading eigenmode predicts fairly well the Strouhal number observed in the nonlinear simulations for all cases, with a maximum difference of $xx\%$. Unlike the case of the circular cylinder, which is marignally stably \citep{barkley-2006}, the present mean flow stability analysis leads to a slightly negative growth rate. Figure \ref{fig:mf_sens}, shows the structural sensitivity of the leading mode. The structural sensitivity was introduced by \cite{giannetti-luchini-2007} as an upper bound for the eigenvalue variation induced by a specific perturbation of the linearised Navier--Stokes operator, namely a `force-velocity coupling' representing feedback from a localised velocity sensor to a localised force actuator at the same location. In this sense, the structural sensitivity in as indicator of the eigenvalue sensitivity and identifies the wavemaker \citep{monkewitz-etal-1993}. The structural sensitivity identifies the flow region where structural modifications of the stability problem produce the strongest drift of the leading eigenvalue and indentifies the so-called wavemaker. The largest values of the sensitivity occur near the cylinders, as the product of the adjoint and direct modes is small in the remaining part of the domain. For longer bodies and smaller $Re$ non null values are observed only in the wake behind the TE along the streamline delimiting the mean recirculating region. The core of the instability responsible for the TE vortex shedding is located downstream the TE. For shorter bodies and/or larger $Re$ the structural sensitivity is non negligible also along the LE shear layers over the lateral sides of the cylinder. Accordingly, in these cases the wavemaker extends to the LE shear layers, as they play a role inthe wave vortex shedding dyanmics.

\end{figure}
%
As mentioned in \S\ref{sec:intro}, for $\AR=1$ three distinct modes become unstable in rapid succession. Mode A first becomes unstable at $Re \approx 175$ with a characteristic wavelength of $\lambda_A \approx 5$ ($\beta_A \approx 1.2$) and the following spatio-temporal symmetry 
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\omega}_x(x,y,\beta,t) = - \hat{\omega}_x(x,-y,\beta,t+/2)
\end{equation}
%
Mode B becomes unstable at $Re \approx 200$, has a characteristic wavelength $\lambda_B \approx 1$ ($\beta_B \approx 5.8$) and satisfies the symmetry:
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\omega}_x(x,y,\beta,t) = + \hat{\omega}_x(x,-y,\beta,t+T/2).
\end{equation}
%
Finally, mode QP becomes unstable at the higher $Re \approx 230$ with a characteristic wavelength of $\lambda_{QP} \approx 2.7$ ($\beta_{QP} \approx 2.3$). These results are in excellent agreement with our findings shown in figure~\ref{fig:mult_AR1_AR1p75}$(a)$ and \ref{fig:modes}, providing a validation of our numerical approach.

Figure~\ref{fig:mult_AR1_AR1p75}(b-d) illustrates the effect of increasing the aspect ratio. As $\AR$ increases, the onset of secondary instabilities is progressively delayes: fixing $Re$ our results show a consistent decrease inthe modulus of the Floquet multipliers associated with the three known modes, indicating a more stable base flow for longer bodies. Quantitativley, the critical Reynolds number increases from $Re_{c2} \approx 175$ for $\AR=1$ to approximately $Re_{c2} =200-225$ for $\AR=1.75$. This trend aligns with the delayed onset of the primary instability as $\AR$ increases reported by \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2021}. Despite the stabilising effect, the sequence of bifurcations remains essentially unchanged for $1 \le \AR \le 1.75$, with mode A becoming unstable first, followed by mode B. Nevertheless, for the investigated values of $Re$ mode $QP$ is not dected for $\AR>1.5$. The characteristic wavelengths of modes A and B exhibit only marginal variations with $\AR$, consistent with the findings of \cite{choi-yang-2014} for $\AR<1$. 

In addition to the three established modes, a new mode, denoted B', emerges for $\AR>1$. Mode B' shares the same spatio-temporal symmetry as mode B, but is characterised by a significantly longer wavelength, comparable to that of mode A; see figure \ref{fig:modes_AR1_AR1p75}. A mode with similar features --- both in wavelength and symmetry --- was previously reported by \cite{ryan-etal-2006} in the wake of elongated bodies with streamlined LE and blunt TE. Within the parameter range considered here, mode B' remains stable for all cases.

%
Figure \ref{fig:mult-AR1p25} details the dependence of the multipliers on $Re$ for the intermediate $\AR=1.25$ case. We observe that $\mu_A$ and $\mu_B$ have a non monotonic dependence on $Re$, meaning that modes A and B are destabilised when $Re$ increases up to $Re = 200$ and then stabilise again when further increasing it. For $Re=240$ mode B is stable. For this intermediate $\AR$ additional multipliers cross the unit circunference for $Re \ge 230$. At $Re \approx 230$ a pair of complex conjugate multipliers an additional quasi-periodic mode becomes unstable (hereafter referred as mode QP'). At $Re \approx 240$ a multiplier with positive real part crosses the unit circumference, being associated to a synchronous mode having the same symmetries as mode $B$ and $B'$, but a much shorter characteristic wavelength, i.e. $\beta \approx 0.5$. This mode is hereafter referred as mode $B'$. Figure \ref{fig:modes}(e-f) shows the spatial structure of these modes.
