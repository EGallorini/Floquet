\section{The bifurcation scenario}

We start by looking at the bifurcation scenario, which is shown in figure \ref{}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Add a figure with $Re$ on the $y$ axis and $\AR$ on the $x$ axis. Add information regarding the primary bifurcation. Add information regarding where we have the flow regime dominated by the TE vortex shedding and by the LE vortex shedding. Add informaiton regarding what is the kind of secondary bifurcation we do expect, by adding also qualitative snapshots of the modes. Here we only show the most unstable mode, and so we do not characterise the secondary instability of the limit cycle. This is also a way to recap the differences in the base flow. 
\end{itemize}
