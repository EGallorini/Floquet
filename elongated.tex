We now turn to longer bodies, using the oblique and horizontal $n = 2$ branches as representative cases for aspect ratios in the range $5 \le \AR \le 7$. Additionally, the case $\AR = 9$ is considered as representative of the oblique $n = 3$ branch. For $n \ge 2$, the secondary instability leads to a three-dimensional flow. Depending on the flow configuration, this instability is driven either by the classical mode A of the wake, or by mode QS, which is associated with the interaction of leading-edge vortices simultaneously accommodated along the cylinder sides.

\subsection{The base flow}

As discussed in \S\ref{} and shown in figure~\ref{} for $Re = 400$, for certain aspect ratios the shedding frequency, when non-dimensionalised using $L$ and $U_\infty$, collapses to the value $0.55n$, where $n$ is the number of LE vortices simultaneously accommodated along the lateral sides. In this regime, the flow frequency is governed by LE vortex shedding, and the wake dynamics is driven by the passage of these vortices over the TE corners. Conversely, for other aspect ratios, the flow dynamics is dominated by TE vortex shedding. In this case, the wake behaviour resembles that of an elongated cylinder with a smooth LE, as previously described by \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022}. Instantaneous visualisations for are shown in figure \ref{} XX ADD FIGURE XX. 

This behaviour is further illustrated in figure~\ref{}, which shows the influence of $Re$ on the shedding period for $5 \le \AR \le 7$ and $\AR = 9$. Different colours identify distinct flow regimes: blue and red for the $n = 2$ and $n=3$ flow regimes dominated by the TE vortex shedding, green for the $n = 2$ regime driven by the LE vortex shedding. As expected, within the considered range of $Re$, $St_L$ increases almost linearly with $\AR$ for $5 \le \AR \le 5.75$ ($n = 2$ oblique branch), while for $6 \le \AR \le 7$ ($n=2$ horizontal branch), it collapses to a nearly constant value close to 1.1. For all aspect ratios considered, the shedding period shows only a weak dependence on $Re$, with this sensitivity increasing slightly with $\AR$. Notably, the period $T$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\AR$: it decreases at lower $Re$ and increases at higher $Re$

\subsection{The unstable modes}

Figure \ref{} presents the leading Floquet multipliers for $5.25 \le \AR \le 9$ at various Reynolds numbers, which are responsible for the onset of three-dimensionality in the flow. Figure \ref{}, in turn, shows the corresponding three-dimensional reconstructions of the associated modes. The bifurcation scenario is observed to vary with $\AR$, in accordance with changes in the topology of the base flow. As detailed in the following, two distinct modes of the wake become unstable for values of $\AR$, where the dynamics of the base flow is governed by the TE vortex shedding. These modes are not observed for $\AR$ where instead the flow dynamics is governed by the LE vortices.

For all values of $\AR$, we identify an unstable branch of Floquet multipliers centered around $\beta \approx 2.1$. This branch consists of a pair of complex conjugate multipliers with negative real parts and very small imaginary parts (see figure \ref{}), suggesting an instability of near-subharmonic nature. This mode, denoted as mode QS \citep{}, indicates that the periodic two-dimensional flow past elongated ($\AR \ge 5$) rectangular cylinders is unstable to a three-dimensional perturbation that is not associated with the wake, but rather with an inviscid interaction involving the LE vortices accommodated along the lateral sides of the cylinder (see \S\ref{} and \cite{}). Indeed, the perturbation field is non-negligible along the lateral surfaces of the cylinder and is concentrated near the $n=2$ and $n=3$ LE vortices for $5 \le \AR \le 7$ and $\AR=9$, respectively. This interpretation is further supported by the observation of a similar instability by \cite{}, who studied the flow past a square flat plate ($L \rightarrow \infty$). In their case, the instability was found to be purely subharmonic, characterised by a single real negative Floquet multiplier crossing the unit circle. This is consistent with the findings of \cite{}, who showed that base flows possessing spatio-temporal symmetry cannot undergo a subharmonic bifurcation. When this symmetry is broken, for instance due to the absence of a TE or due to slight asymmetries in the base flow (see \cite{} and \cite{}), a subharmonic bifurcation becomes possible.

The existence of the QS mode clearly demonstrates that the bifurcation pathway to turbulence in the flow past elongated rectangular cylinders differs significantly from that observed in elongated bodies with smooth leading edges. In the latter case, secondary flow instabilities are governed by wake dynamics across all $\AR$ (see \cite{}), whereas here, the primary three-dimensional instability is driven by mechanisms involving the leading-edge vortices.
XX AD DEFFECT OF $\AR$ on $Re_{c}$

XX CHARACTERISE OTHER TWO MODES 

XX

Figure \ref{} shows the unstable branches of Floquet multipliers for $5.25 \le \AR \le 5.75$ ($n=2$ oblique brach), $\AR=6,7$ ($n=2$ horizontal branch) and $\AR=9$ ($n=3$ oblique branch). The scanario changes with $\AR$ with different modes becoming unstable, in agreement with the change of the base flow dynamics. The case with $\AR=5$ has been discussed in \cite{chiarini-quadrio-auteri-2022d}.

We start characterising the $n=2$ and $n=3$ oblique branches, i.e. $5.25 \le \AR \le 5.75$ and $\AR=9$. For these $\AR$s we find three different modes, with the order with which they become unstable that changes with the aspect ratio. For $5 \le \AR \le 5.25$ and $\AR=9$ the first mode to become unstable is mode $QS$. This mode is characterised by a pair of complex conjugate Floquet multipliers having negative real part and almost null imaginary part, with $\mu = (xx,xx)$ for $\AR=5.5$, $Re=450$ and $\beta=2$. \textcolor{red}{XX Add figure with the real and complex partx XX} This instability is driven by the inviscid interaction of the LE vortices that are simultaneously accomodated along the lateral sides of the cylinder \citep{pierrhumbert-widnall-1982}, and is characterised by a characteristic spanwise wavenumber of $\beta \approx 2$, which corresponds to a wavelength of $\lambda \approx \pi$


XX PER $\AR=5.5$ per $Re \in (450,400)$ sembra che ci sia di nuovo effetto della scia secondaria. E' presente a Re bassi e poi sparisce a Re piu alti. Bisogna caratterizzare questo aspetto in generale. Quindi per evitare problemi, per Re intermedi rifaccio Floquet per una dimensionel del dominio più piccola che mi garantisce la periodicità XX

\begin{itemize}
  \item Here we look at the second oblique branch of the $St_L-\AR$ plane. Here we have already found that for $\AR=5$ the first mode to become unstable is mode QS, i.e. the quasi-subharmonic mode.
  \item We now investigate what happens when increasing $\AR$. We recall that this is the range where the vortex shedding is dominated by the TE. This means that the dynamics of the TE vortex shedding dominates and is not directly influenced by the vortex shedding from the LE as in the oblique branches. As shown in figure \ref{fig:mult_AR5s}, for $\AR=5$ the only unstable mode is of subharmonic nature and is the so-called mode $QS$. As $\AR$ is increased, instead, a new mode of synchronous nature appears (in this case the multipliers are real and positive). For $\AR=5.25$ this mode is stable. For $\AR=5.35$ this mode approaches the unit circle. For $\AR=5.5$ this mode is unstable, and its growth rate is larger than the corresponding one associated with mode $QS$. The second mode here detected resembles mode $A$ for the wake past short cylinders. 
  \item Mode QS is an unstable mode of the recirculating region along the lateral sides of the cylinder. This is visualised in figure \ref{fig:mult_AR5s} (note that the mote is maximum there and not in the wake). For additional details see \citep{chiarini-etal-2022}. The synchronous mode, instead, is an unsteady mode of the wake and share several properties with the classical mode $A$ of the circular cylinder.
  \item For the arise of the new mode $A$ in the $5.25 \le \AR \le 5.75$ regime look at the works by Aleksyuk \& Heil (2023) and Aleksyuk \& Heil (2024). To answer the question "Why this mode is not detected for $\AR=5$? Why it becomes unstable only at larger $\AR$?" We can start looking whether also in this case the mechanism proposed by Aleksyuk \& Heil (2023,2024) works. If this is the case, we can see if for $\AR=5$ we actually have something different. 
  \item \textcolor{blue}{For $\AR=5.5$ we have that mode $A'$ and $QS$ become unstable is short succession. We can use DNS to see how do they appear. We start from $Re=450$ and then increase progressively $Re$. Look for an indicator to characterise how the flow moves from one regime to the other.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For these $\AR$, the secondary flow instability is due to mode $QS$ that leads to a three-dimensional state. Interestingly, for these $\AR$ mode $A$ is not detected. This is consistent with the fact that for this range of $\AR$, at the intermediate $Re$, the flow is driven by the LE vortex shedding, that modifies the flow dynamics in the near-wake region where the triggering mechanism of mode $A$ takes place.
